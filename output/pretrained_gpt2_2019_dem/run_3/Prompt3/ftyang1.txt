Andrew Yang is a fantastic man! He doesn't even have to go out to work all the time. :grimacing_face:
Andrew Yang is a real progressive. His platform supports an agenda where the rich pay for public education without ever paying for public healthcare. If you want to be a progressive, give it to him.
Andrew Yang is a great idea! As someone who often complains about this, he's done amazing work for progressive causes like #MedicareForAll, fighting for equal rights, & voting rights.
Andrew Yang is a Russian asset. He's a liar, racist, xenophobic, and misogynistic. We can't wait until Nov 8th is over to vote him out of office. The election is coming and it starts now.
Andrew Yang is a racist ass, right? And he used to back up all the shit Hillary said about her.
Andrew Yang is a hero. A leader who says he 'll fight for a fair and just trial. A leader who understands the importance of getting everyone the results they really want. #DemDebate
Andrew Yang is a really good candidate, but he's also one of many candidates who's been making a deliberate mistake not running for the presidency.
Andrew Yang is a racist, misogynist, xenophobic piece of shit, and yet somehow, when I ask him how is it possible that #KamalaHarris and the #NeverTrump Democrats in the #DemocraticParty still support Trump, he jumps
Andrew Yang is a man of promise. It's why he's the new POTUS.
Andrew Yang is a smart candidate but I think this is a bigger concern...
Andrew Yang is a smart, powerful, articulate politician, and he's running for President.
Andrew Yang is a white supremacist because your racist father would've kicked this guy out years ago.
Andrew Yang is a fantastic candidate and @USER has helped shape the #YangGang. He's not exactly known for his philanthropies, but they support his advocacy for working people and economic rights. üôèüèª #Bernie2020
Andrew Yang is a fucking fraud. Why on earth would he care if people die? Why would he care when people die? When he went to see a neurologist he couldn't diagnose Andrew Yang's paralysis.
Andrew Yang is a #MedicareForAll champion. Let's get rid of private insurance!
Andrew Yang is a good guy and a true leader. He is the guy who brought us Bill and Hillary. The Bernie bros just don't mind the Bernie haters.

Andrew Yang is a hero : a former Republican is the closest thing Democrats can come. #Warren2020

Andrew Yang is a damn legend. The whole community is standing up for what's right.
Andrew Yang is a real possibility. But I think he's also an unapologetic misogynist who just doesn't see a way to make the UBI a deal with the Dem party, and the corporate Democratic Party. He won't
Andrew Yang is a liar, no matter how he tries. #BernieTownHall
Andrew Yang is a great guy. But I thought this was an easy sell. That Yang can't even beat Trump is something that's not working for him.
Andrew Yang is a candidate?! Let me know when it's official! :face_savoring_food:
Andrew Yang is a progressive and the first African American to run for president
Andrew Yang is a true friend, and I think he helped get Joe Biden elected in 2016 but will help Bernie in 2020 in ways that will be most beneficial to our country

Andrew Yang is a real deal. I like him but now that I'm out of political consulting it leaves me no choice.

Andrew Yang is a true progressive. He can help us. Join us here
Andrew Yang is a Republican and didn't bother engaging with Tulsi's campaign. Tulsi's positions are exactly what the MSM told her to do and she hasn't done any. You're just ignoring that.

Andrew Yang is a true progressive. You should look it up yourself.
Andrew Yang is a fantastic advocate for small business owners, I like him. I like @USER. And we should pay him a lot of money to help get him elected someday!
Andrew Yang is a Republican, but he's against Trump impeachment. He's opposed to Trump impeachment because Trump has not been a positive role model from the beginning of the Trump Administration. No one gives a shit about Americans. Period.
Andrew Yang is a fucking idiot. I have no sympathy for him. Fuck that.
Andrew Yang is a Democrat that the people need. #YangGang

Andrew Yang is a very good man at making good stuff happen.
Andrew Yang is a strong candidate, but it didn't help that he took money from a hostile foreign power that didn't have any standing to have anything to do with the election.
Andrew Yang is a smart and hard working guy and a leader and I'm so proud of how he is leading with a diverse coalition, all under one roof.
Andrew Yang is a very good candidate for some people. #DemocraticDebate

Andrew Yang is a lot like you. You've never said that he has no experience or knowledge of any presidential campaigning skills. You claim that you lack any empathy, or that he has not had the opportunity to articulate them. And it's
Andrew Yang is a fucking idiot and so are you.
Andrew Yang is a leader and a real leader in the fight to end hunger and poor hunger in the #UNFIT @USER @USER @USER @USER #EndHunger @USER @USER @USER
Andrew Yang is a nice one, too.
Andrew Yang is a man of compassion. He is an intellectual. Not a fan of this country's policies.
Andrew Yang is a wonderful candidate for the Democrats. I would go as far as to say if he endorsed Bloomberg then he would be in my top four or five.
Andrew Yang is a great man. He talks about working for the people. He's passionate about protecting and expanding women's rights, voting rights, & environmental protections to the American people. We will never forget what he did for us in Washington

Andrew Yang is a fucking tool! Let's take away the privilege of white male privilege as well! @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER
Andrew Yang is a lot better but Yang's approach doesn't offer as much stability. Warren is more likely to work to shift away from corporate control and create universal Medicare and Medicare for all.
Andrew Yang is a strong, progressive, independent woman running on ideas of common-sense reform, social programs, healthcare--are there any plans for those topics that Bernie or Warren would disagree with?
Andrew Yang is a good old man, does anyone in Yang Gang believe anything he says?

Andrew Yang is a progressive who is fighting to save the planet because he wants us to #ClimateChangeIsReal and if we continue to push back, he's going to take the fight all the way to the White House, where it belongs.
Andrew Yang is a smart politician who is smart enough to realize that being a Dem is the only correct course. I think his primary challenge has a chance of being exposed as some sort of socialist. Unfortunately Yang isn't going to be that.
Andrew Yang is a billionaire. Just saying.
Andrew Yang is a strong but little known candidate for Congress, which the House is currently being led.
Andrew Yang is a Republican. Is it still true that he does?

Andrew Yang is a national treasure :red_heart: :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:

Andrew Yang is a good guy! He's a good guy!!!

Andrew Yang is a badass

Andrew Yang is a #YangGang member and @USER should not have endorsed Trump.

Andrew Yang is a billionaire so he's not worth shit.
Andrew Yang is a ‚Äú radical Left ‚Äù, and he isn't exactly a progressive, no matter how he talks about it. Just sayin '.
Andrew Yang is a terrible person. That's saying everything.
Andrew Yang is a strong candidate, and I 'd support him if he's the Democratic candidate. But I think Warren is just more qualified than Yang. But I don't think Yang would be the right fit, let alone the way the
Andrew Yang is a billionaire. He never has anything to do with what's happening right now.
Andrew Yang is a man of principles. @USER #YangGang
Andrew Yang is a liar, an old white guy, and a racist. In a year and a half, he 'll be on his way to nowhere in the future. I don't see how anyone could not see that.
Andrew Yang is a socialist, he's very open about his experience with socialism ( and some basic economic principles ) as a child. :face_with_rolling_eyes:
Andrew Yang is a great candidate for our future.
Andrew Yang is a Russian agent, with all of his foreign help.
Andrew Yang is a great communicator... :sparkles: #WinWithWarren #EqualityTownHall
Andrew Yang is a liar and, his campaign has already had their plans exposed.
Andrew Yang is a terrible and extremely unqualified political analyst, and that, along with his utter disregard for voters, is probably why his polls are so low. This was a very big deal for his campaign.
Andrew Yang is a great candidate. But let's not forget that even if you like Elizabeth he's not my choice. #DemDebate #DemDebates2

Andrew Yang is a good guy. And he is smart and will answer every question.
Andrew Yang is a traitor to America. He keeps inviting foreign governments to interfere with our elections that lead us to Trump like 2016. He is a traitor to the planet. He will never do a damn thing about the #climate crisis and we need him
Andrew Yang is a candidate, for the 1st time, who will lead the progressive movement. If he can defeat tRump, he needs to be able to win without using the DNC's Super Tuesday strategy of holding primaries / caucuses where the
Andrew Yang is a wonderful and intelligent young man and I am all for Elizabeth Warren. I think the DNC could at least try them to some extent, if they want a chance to change the party structure in good way.
Andrew Yang is a traitor to U. S. The rest of the world doesn't agree here. It took a lot of people to come together to do what is right. To support him. It's an honor not to hear from him
Andrew Yang is a national treasure and I love him.
Andrew Yang is a brilliant candidate ; the American people deserve so much better.
Andrew Yang is a good guy with a lot of baggage. That's unfortunate and an important one IMO.

Andrew Yang is a great candidate. I think it's time for us to have a candidate who will unite people and solve issues like this.
Andrew Yang is a socialist. #DemDebate

Andrew Yang is a true American hero.
Andrew Yang is a great progressive. The establishment is now a death cult. I know he gets my vote but he will not be the nominee. The MSM, Fox News, establishment bought and co has to continue supporting him. He is not electable

Andrew Yang is a very effective Vice President

Andrew Yang is a huge threat to our democracy. He's basically a Democrat in a suit, but I'm happy, because I'm voting for him and am a progressive. If he's the Dem nominee, he's more
Andrew Yang is a bad guy in a good way.
Andrew Yang is a fucking fool. He supports the same fucking corporate tax cuts over and expecting them to be better for the American worker than the corporate ones, only because he thinks it's all in his pocket. Fuck off, you absolute moron

Andrew Yang is a master of ‚Äú talking to your manager ‚Äù. He had a chat with a reporter last year.
Andrew Yang is a great advocate for #MedicareForAll #YangGang4Life and he is the only Presidential candidate advocating that you get your Medicare for All if you have a pre-existing condition.

Andrew Yang is a hero too.
Andrew Yang is a great way to begin your day and my friend is a cool fellow too!

Andrew Yang is a lot like FDR but much better ‚Äú president. ‚Äù

Andrew Yang is a damn liar. He thinks he's winning everything when he just lies about everything and won't do anything.
Andrew Yang is a bad guy. He can not understand why we need to wait this long to fix the housing crisis until he is president - he has no experience in dealing with homelessness or addressing economic inequality.

Andrew Yang is a traitor. You say that like he had a gun he was in the wrong! You are both evil.

Andrew Yang is a good guy. No need to attack his character. Just a thought.
Andrew Yang is a great politician. He ran as a libertarian / left wing candidate, but was one of the few who actually fought against Medicare For All and actually improved healthcare systems ( which I agree is what Yang is ). His policy proposals are great

Andrew Yang is a billionaire by default. Like most billionaires in politics, he hasn't taken any corporate money. He has been trying to build a broad coalition. Yang's grassroots campaign is small and he could've used the money he has
Andrew Yang is a Democrat. His ideas are better than yours. Keep trying.
Andrew Yang is a good candidate, but not by a long shot.
Andrew Yang is a better candidate than @USER

Andrew Yang is a brilliant candidate who is building on Obama's historic coalitions and I look forward to cheering on him in my district. If we can't get him where he needs to be now, do not run for President. #YangG
Andrew Yang is a great guy. He just isn't one to be shamed about.
Andrew Yang is a great choice, as always. He's just getting there by having the same ideas, same platform that Bernie is, though his supporters aren't willing to follow him. The DNC is too good to allow this. #Dem
