Bernie Sanders is a white guy. I'm an age 52 person and I'm an older woman that was told that the way it impacts me is if I don't vote. Please please. We need you. Support
Bernie Sanders is a walking, talking stump for the White People that we need to keep going and that I'm proud of. via @USER
Bernie Sanders is a billionaire and a white man with no empathy or compassion. He was just trying a month ago about the pandemic in Boston. He was lying. His lies are why #MayorPete is so far away from winning.
Bernie Sanders is a Russian and is just a Republican trying to screw Democrats again. If he wins he 'll use any trick they can to turn him into the worst party ever. Just ask Joe Biden.

Bernie Sanders is a disgrace to the Democratic Party and to the Jewish people.
Bernie Sanders is a #Democrat, but his #SocialSecurity isn't his issue, and he's running for President. He's a socialist in the sense that he claims to be one, but not a democratic socialist.
Bernie Sanders is a billionaire with a very rich father and a wife, so I don't hold him in the same contempt or shame as Biden or Gillibrand for the lack of a woman's voice ( I will never support Bloomberg )

Bernie Sanders is a traitor to the nation today. It's time we get him out of office. #Bernie2020 #BernieBros #BernieIsABitchPresident
Bernie Sanders is a fucking mess anyway. And there are so many of us who will vote for him if he were the nominee in the general. But the people who are just fine with Trump ( as are you, unfortunately ) are fine with Biden.
Bernie Sanders is a great candidate! You can not win a general election without support from the people you have alienated and demobilised on Twitter. It's only natural that you want to win, but also that you have the resources
