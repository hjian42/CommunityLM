Elizabeth Warren is a good candidate, but she's playing us into a losing situation.
Elizabeth Warren is a better choice for President than @USER. She would be a more likely nominee to help restore our country back to the promised land.

Elizabeth Warren is a good example. She's smart and intelligent and can do good in some areas.
