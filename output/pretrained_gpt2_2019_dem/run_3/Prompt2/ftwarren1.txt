Elizabeth Warren is out of touch.
Elizabeth Warren is probably my least-favorite candidate, because she can't answer simple questions, but she answers tough ones and I am pretty much against that right now.
Elizabeth Warren is a fraud as are all those GOP men in their 40s. Their whole party has been bought and paid for. The establishment has been bought and paid for.
Elizabeth Warren is going to lose her Senate bid if we let that happen.
Elizabeth Warren is getting the respect that Trump and many Republicans are desperately hoping he won't be able to earn for the next four years. As someone whose grandfather served in the Military, and whose grandfather, John McCain is a POW, I get angry
Elizabeth Warren is too old to run this time, how about Warren?

Elizabeth Warren is the only candidate I would consider backing right now.
Elizabeth Warren is a Republican no longer! She's an unapologetic leftwinger. Warren is a neoliberal liberal, who's a bit more subtle. #NeverWarren
Elizabeth Warren is the epitome of a neoliberal, and if you haven't yet, check out her video. It's literally about her wealth tax, which has been proven to hurt people, and how it will benefit the environment.
Elizabeth Warren is one of my top choices and I can't wait to vote for her! #Warren2020
Elizabeth Warren is leading the race & has an all female ticket.
Elizabeth Warren is the most qualified Democrat to get the most votes and not be the nominee for President. And that is an accurate assessment

Elizabeth Warren is a hero. She has nothing to do with the DNC, her donors, or the Dems.
Elizabeth Warren is the only one who understands the issue.
Elizabeth Warren is the one who says she can't say no because it's been over 40 years and everyone who is younger agrees with it, but it doesn't seem like it has shifted significantly in the last year...
Elizabeth Warren is doing the lord's work. @USER is still fighting the good fight against the evil that is right in his heart. We are still living in an era where our democracy is being strangled. #DemocratDebate

Elizabeth Warren is the only candidate I expect to be mentioned in the race.
Elizabeth Warren is in a position where she doesn't understand that she has to go back to school to finish the degree
Elizabeth Warren is as bad as she gets. As bad as Elizabeth I voted for her in 2004 and I'm happy that is. She's my pick but I still want my 2nd choice ( Bernie ).
Elizabeth Warren is a warlock as usual. The last woman couldn't even win the Senate in 2016. The first woman was a cop as usual. The last woman couldn't win the presidency in 2020.
Elizabeth Warren is a liar or has been lying over and over as she has been accused of. Her own words are used and that is all we have to know. #Bernie2020 is the one who can take his message to the people. The others
Elizabeth Warren is a progressive. Her plans mean bold and achievable for every human. All Bernie supporters should listen to her and support her.
Elizabeth Warren is not on my favorite train tonight, which is a bonus, because she is on my favorite train, which is just a bonus.

Elizabeth Warren is a fighter and a fighter.
Elizabeth Warren is a leader I want to see in Congress but I have to say, it's still a shame a few of these ppl did their best to make her the only one she can be.
Elizabeth Warren is a great candidate for Congress. Her heart and the passion required to push the envelope of what we need and need now. That seems to be a winning combination today.
Elizabeth Warren is my favorite running mate and I hate her. A real progressive is at the top of my favorites list. Who else is going to take my wallet??
Elizabeth Warren is definitely a better candidate than Jill Stein.
Elizabeth Warren is a hero to all of us. Check out her video.

Elizabeth Warren is a fucking fraud and I love and miss her.

Elizabeth Warren is a liar. You are making my blood boil at the truth.
Elizabeth Warren is a great candidate. I 'd give anything to meet her level of Presidential ability if she didn't have too much self-promotion. In this climate where the media is a huge deal, she 'd be an asset.
Elizabeth Warren is not going to win, so that's irrelevant. The first thing she needs to do is win.

Elizabeth Warren isn't exactly as progressive as she thinks.
Elizabeth Warren is a progressive who is on her way to becoming one... why don't we start impeachment hearings and start having discussions that focus on the issues in between. Or do we need something that isn't already there and don't have
Elizabeth Warren is one of our own. Join us

Elizabeth Warren is on the right side of history! She's not just a female of color, she is a woman of color & has a voice. She's a strong candidate for women on the ticket.

Elizabeth Warren is an awful candidate so maybe a good idea, but I still love her
Elizabeth Warren is so on point here. She is a genuinely great candidate. @USER on the other hand.
