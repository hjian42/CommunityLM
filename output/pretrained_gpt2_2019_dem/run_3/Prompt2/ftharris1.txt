Kamala Harris is the right answer for what the voters needs
Kamala Harris is a woman of color who is qualified, intelligent, and strong. Not so with Biden. She does not represent all Americans. Just as she does not represent our values. #biden2020
Kamala Harris is the real deal. Her ability to articulate and explain her plans and plans without being flippant can't be argued over by those who don't. Her message seems to resonate with the left.

Kamala Harris is not a Democrat. She is not a US Senator and neither is Kamala Harris.
