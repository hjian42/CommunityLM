Andrew Yang is taking a little too serious on healthcare, but the man in front of HIM for everything is the WORST :flushed_face: #DemDebate
Andrew Yang is a socialist so that's good, but I also like his support for Medicare for all. He also isn't saying all gun laws should be abolished. He just * wants * to start mass market healthcare?

Andrew Yang is like that guy who eats a pizza in a salad and starts over and then eats it after taking a nap.
Andrew Yang is a terrible candidate. #DemDebate

Andrew Yang is the only real Democrat. And he isn't one he can count on for anything... He's a terrible candidate and will be in a very rough place in 2020.
Andrew Yang is one of the most effective politicians running for president. He really should run for Governor of North Carolina. The first place he will go for a donation is from the state itself, not the campaigns. He will also help defeat McConnell.

Andrew Yang is my new favorite candidate, but she's not gonna be good enough to be president. If she gets the nomination she's gonna vote for Trump. There are people voting for him because some believe he will turn the republic blue.
Andrew Yang is also extremely vocal about the need for universal background checks on gun purchases. He has a new policy where all Background Checks must be applied by your State. How can I say @USER isn't a true leader? #YangGang
Andrew Yang is not the type of candidate to support universal healthcare, but he is a thoughtful and forward-thinking candidate who isn't a centrist.
Andrew Yang is a good guy too. #Yang2020 #Medicare4All
Andrew Yang is a wonderful human and I'm so happy to have him on my team. And, that's a big endorsement.
Andrew Yang is now on a debate stage. #DemDebate2

Andrew Yang is the only one that I trust to talk back to me
Andrew Yang is the only presidential candidate whose history can not be ignored.
Andrew Yang is the kind of candidate who can turn your head and turn it around and make a positive impression. Joe Biden is the guy whose vision and vision made that happen ‚Äî and he deserves the same.
Andrew Yang is running on the same populist policies as Bernie Sanders @USER was in early 2016 - and the fact that Joe didn't campaign enough on them shows #TheLoudHouse
Andrew Yang is a true American hero. He doesn't have to be like you and your ilk. He is an American hero. He did the right thing. He helped protect us from a lot of Trump supporters.
Andrew Yang is really getting the crowd back on track
Andrew Yang isn't really a Dem. He's a Republican. If he's not his party's nominee by the end of the century, we need to be sure he isn't the one to beat Trump / Pence. If
Andrew Yang is the same as 2016 and a bigger improvement to our 2020 primary than Trump. But Warren needs to be the next POC in 2020, and the future looks bright with her. She can also be the 2020 candidate for the party.
Andrew Yang is our last hope. If we elect a genuinely progressive, just about any other viable candidate ( we must make it possible for the rest of us ) what can happen instead?

Andrew Yang is the only hope to make the 2020 primaries more about the economy, rather than fighting election interference.
Andrew Yang is definitely the President's choice, but Yang should be the VP.
Andrew Yang is amazing. I don't believe he 'd be the face of the party in the General elections. He could fill his office with competent people whose only objective is winning the nomination.
Andrew Yang is a lot closer than you 'd make him out to be. He has done a lot of work to build the movement... I think Biden and Bloomberg can both get things done! I wouldn't give up my progressive principles at this

Andrew Yang is not the candidate who will do anything but take a seat. #YangIsBack #YangIsUnited
