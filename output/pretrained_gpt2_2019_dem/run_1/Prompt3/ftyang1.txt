Andrew Yang is a really great Senator and I agree with Yang's stance and believe that should be the goal. But it's a mistake to not make a case for Yang's policies. There's no reason to run against Sanders.

Andrew Yang is a “ socialist ” :face_with_rolling_eyes: :face_with_rolling_eyes: :face_with_rolling_eyes:

Andrew Yang is a millennial, but... who is Joe Biden? #DemDebate
Andrew Yang is a good guy & we shouldn't give him another chance to show that he has value for anything besides being a political tool. Bernie and Biden should not be pitted against each other for anything.

Andrew Yang is a great example of why Bernie can not win. He's already lost by 3 million votes. And still refuses to concede and refuse to accept defeat. Sanders is a leader

Andrew Yang is a good fit for our party.
