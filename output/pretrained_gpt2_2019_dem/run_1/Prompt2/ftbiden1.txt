Joe Biden isn't afraid to speak against the President he's afraid it could create more division among Americans not just Republicans in the General Election. And he's fighting a losing battle.
Joe Biden is still not on the stage of taking the coronavirus seriously, so I 'd argue he 'll need to be pushed to take a harder position as to whether that's more important - the country as a whole.
Joe Biden is probably the most electable candidate for president because he isn't a white guy ( nor am I ). He will beat trump because I see a lot more of the black people running from the GOP than they did in 2016 and I
