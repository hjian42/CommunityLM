feminists are the problem? The only thing that makes sense is the anti-vaxxer group, and the reason they're using those terms is not btwn vaccines
feminists are making a point to say men need to STFU. Also, women don't need to be told what they can and can not do with their bodies or lives ; men, because we can be our own creatures.
feminists are an extension of the patriarchy, so that's a whole other reason. There are people that can't imagine a cis woman being offended by a trans woman's gender presentation, even if they're being made fun of for being
feminists are being divisive against women in STEM. @USER @USER @USER #STEMJobs
feminists are doing, even after decades. But, since there are so many white, cisgender men who benefit from “ identity politics ”, please don't try to pretend the problem exists anymore.
