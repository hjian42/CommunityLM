Elizabeth Warren is the perfect choice for @USER.
Elizabeth Warren is running in a Presidential primary that's going to be a huge deal for me. I'm nervous about who has control of the debates and who doesn't.

Elizabeth Warren is my senator. I will vote for anyone running, including Bernie if the dem nominee isn't our nominee and I will do everything I can to help them get there.
Elizabeth Warren is a corporate neoliberal. We need to give her some credit because she went on Fox to try to make Bernie's policies resonant. And when she did, she's not a corporate neoliberal.

Elizabeth Warren is a liar. She blames all of the candidates for the 2008 economy, she's a liar about her own record on immigration, she's a liar about how to solve our problems. She uses that line to attack and attack everyone

Elizabeth Warren is a real leader. She knows how to unite the party and make the election year a win for #BernieSanders!

Elizabeth Warren is an anti-corruption advocate who would be a great ally for the democratic party. That's the key. What she's arguing with is an out-of-touch politician. It seems all the centrist Dems are right on healthcare
Elizabeth Warren is the one who is always the winner.

Elizabeth Warren is not, on top of this list, the President of the United States.

Elizabeth Warren is a liar... She has no empathy for the millions of people. She doesn't even want to fight that.

Elizabeth Warren is a woman of color, and a woman of color who has lived her whole life with full knowledge, experience and trust in a progressive political system that is actually more democratic. For her and Bernie to get in there, it's time
Elizabeth Warren is a fighter and has accomplished nothing since she first entered the race but she is taking steps to make it to the top. She just needs to be an old white man if she wants to get the nom. Biden is a self enriching

Elizabeth Warren is an American hero. She did it for other people.
Elizabeth Warren is a white male socialist socialist, but she's just another Republican with a white male socialist heritage ( though there are ways to distinguish between the two ). The point of being a socialist is not as the problem is, but to be
Elizabeth Warren is a better and kinder person. A fighter and friend - who can do her work without being overly defensive, which I mean comes off like a nasty remark - her campaign will still work better, and the establishment will keep pushing more.
Elizabeth Warren is a real leader and not afraid to fight for what is right if that's how it is.
Elizabeth Warren is now making herself the first presidential candidate ever to deliver a speech as unapologetically as her :
Elizabeth Warren is very much in play in a race to the bottom in the Democratic primary race. Will Bernie's lead come down to Warren or Sanders or the far right? And which candidate will he choose?
Elizabeth Warren is just another corporate puppet
Elizabeth Warren is the last person standing who can get shit done. A good leader moves left, the right moves right, she's got to work together from day 1

Elizabeth Warren is a master legislator on social issues, the same sort of person who wrote an oped on the economic impacts of Trump's trade war with China.
Elizabeth Warren isn't even one of the Democrats running in 2020. She will make a lot of mistakes, & in her own right she will be viewed as a coward for running. When does that change?
Elizabeth Warren is right... #BernieIsMyPresident

Elizabeth Warren is definitely my choice, but she's the one I would support for President.

Elizabeth Warren is the only real progressive running for president
Elizabeth Warren is a fucking embarrassment. No wonder she's sitting with Bernie over & over again. You don't need to say it louder than I do you're just trying TO shut people up, but you can also ask all of us
Elizabeth Warren is not only the female presidential candidate, she IS THE MOST CANDIDATE OF MY TIME. How could anyone expect anything other than a mediocre white guy to get the nomination?
Elizabeth Warren is the smartest person ever to run a presidential campaign.
Elizabeth Warren is a force to be reckoned with. The only thing I'm concerned about is her healthcare policy.
Elizabeth Warren is not doing this because she is on a $ 15 a day ( or minimum wage )... She is just fighting for a middle class tax cut and universal Medicare. She wants everyone covered... or is this all a setup?
Elizabeth Warren isn't going to win in Florida. In fact most of her voters don't think she 'll win there.
Elizabeth Warren is taking that leap.
Elizabeth Warren is on a tear in her campaign for governor of @USER after her recent victory speech about making #blackbusiness the top priority in the state. She is a true representation of what it is to be black in #2020.

Elizabeth Warren is about to be in Washington, DC in a week. The news is exciting, but we need to be prepared.
