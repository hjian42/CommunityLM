Kamala Harris is the one to keep me in the loop but she isn't a Republican.
Kamala Harris is one of my all time favorites. #KamalaHarris2020 #KHive
Kamala Harris is an Independent who also has a great chance to beat Trump. She will need to show the entire nation who is for Medicare For All and her platform can not be erased by corporate media.

Kamala Harris is a cop, you fucking ghoul, go away, get an actual job. Your family was the original victims of the police state. You need to be locked up. The crime is the black community is a gang.

Kamala Harris is the woman who lost me when she asked that question, the smartest person of all time.
Kamala Harris is the only other Black Democratic presidential candidate to make as much as I agree with Joe Biden & his policies. But is that really true at the time he was elected? Can we hold Trump accountable then because he isn't?
Kamala Harris is getting more and more pushback :eyes:

Kamala Harris is my candidate! I'm proud to vote for her in the General election!

Kamala Harris is running. The only black person to be called a name at @USER's DSA was @USER who had the audacity to vote for Kamala before she even announced.
Kamala Harris is not going to be the nominee. She's not fit. And she hasn't even been vetted and endorsed by a major political entity. The DNC hasn't bought up enough of their endorsement for her.
Kamala Harris is a woman of character.
Kamala Harris is a progressive and she's not a Democrat. If your political affiliation isn't conservative. #Bernie2020
Kamala Harris is the true voice of reason in this nation. #WarrenForTheWin

Kamala Harris is my choice
Kamala Harris is not a liar, she said it in 2018. No one asked her to apologize for that in 2019. She's still a liar, and has admitted it as much as her GOP colleagues.
Kamala Harris is the # 1 on your list of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.
Kamala Harris isn't even an acceptable standard bearer for @USER. AOC doesn't represent me or my people like the way Kamala does. #Warren2020
Kamala Harris is a hero by the way lol. You should be proud of her and proud of people like her.
Kamala Harris is my top pick for AG asap, she would bring a sharp intellect and experience to a very difficult position and I would love it if she were POTUS :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:

Kamala Harris is now officially in the race and it's a real mess and the progressive media should be demanding a recount by March 6th or the media will have to shut up about it
Kamala Harris is the one that will have a real effect on the 2020 race. She was one of our first choices from the beginning and always has been.
Kamala Harris is so much smarter than he is. We have a lot of stupid people on the @USER. The only thing we have is a group of idiots. The rest of us have a lot more stupid people.
Kamala Harris is still a top tier candidate who will make history in this cycle of the election.
Kamala Harris is doing a great job of holding her opponents feet to the fire, and bringing them there through a series of bold, bold, bold, bold, bold prosecutorial plans for immigration. ( Which she's also got going )
Kamala Harris is running for pres., not for president.
Kamala Harris is a terrible candidate and could not win the nomination with Bernie's policies. #DemDebate
Kamala Harris is a master communicator, but the rest are just ignorant. Read the tweet to see the full interview with President Donald Trump.
Kamala Harris is the only true blue candidate not trying to put her foot in the neck. This is the only realistic hope we have.
Kamala Harris is our future. I don't have any faith in her.
Kamala Harris is not running for President. Why do we need to focus on white people running and not on the candidate that we love
Kamala Harris is getting a lot of heat for her record endorsing segregationists over Bernie Sanders on this issue. My guess is that her record is not well-developed enough for her to be in the position of President of the United States. And

Kamala Harris is my first choice, but I think she's a much better candidate than Trump. I really like what she does for the working class. She's a very accomplished woman ( and has made a lot of money ),
Kamala Harris is a black woman & I agree completely. Bernie & Tulsi on a separate ticket. A Harris VP, on a ticket. I am no different than Bernie supporters & Tulsi supporters. So long as we get rid of Trump
Kamala Harris is not the brightest light in Iowa or New Hampshire. I get that she's more of a Bernie or Bust type but he is not a Democrat that is more of a social Democrat.
Kamala Harris is the best candidate and Bernie will make a great president.
Kamala Harris isn't even the most progressive member.
Kamala Harris is one of the most progressive candidates in modern history & she's running against Joe Biden.
Kamala Harris is a liar. She was not in a position of power when she was an elected official and did not serve. I was at the WH and I know more about history, but let's not forget that she actually won.
Kamala Harris is the only candidate in 2020 that actually has the courage to admit that she would take us into foreign wars. #Harris2020 #KamalaHarris #Kamala2020
Kamala Harris is still talking about getting her hair washed tonight. Maybe @USER is going to ask her why.
Kamala Harris is the only candidate for the white male vote who did not vote for Hillary as Senator in 2016 and who can not say the same about Elizabeth Warren.
Kamala Harris is so impressive the pundits can't stop talking about her. Warren is not as impressive as Sanders

Kamala Harris is the only candidate I really like with progressive policy priorities so that's good
Kamala Harris is in jail, her testimony will be heard, and there is no “ good reason ” to impeach.

Kamala Harris is only getting my vote for president.
Kamala Harris is gonna be president soon, in 2020!

Kamala Harris is the ONLY candidate that would be a real president and a better role model than Trump

Kamala Harris is a hero for America and it's not because she's white.

Kamala Harris is right, most people are sick and tired of the Democratic Party.
Kamala Harris is a very credible candidate, who, for some reason, has spent her own money to push this insane idea. I'm so tired of both Bernie & Warren supporters, especially from the outside, bashing a man that is so
