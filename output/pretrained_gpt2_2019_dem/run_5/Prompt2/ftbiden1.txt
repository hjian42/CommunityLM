Joe Biden is the man of surprise for me. ( And, yet, you're not getting that many impressions. )

Joe Biden is not a Democrat & will never be. It took awhile for Dems to realize that. Now we see the GOP with its #RepublicanSuck #GOPCriminatry. #GOPCoverup
Joe Biden is such a coward he wouldn't be president. How many Republicans actually know how he will look and act? The GOP has let him down twice in one day. No excuses. There is a reason he can't stand even if it

Joe Biden is running for president, and his team isn't making a mistake in realizing their strategy is to alienate women from his party.
