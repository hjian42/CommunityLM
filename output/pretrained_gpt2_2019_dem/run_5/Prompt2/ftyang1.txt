Andrew Yang is doing a beautiful job of explaining how he plans to solve the #ClimateCrisis while still getting more folks to buy renewable tech. His ideas are sound and the fact that #Bernie2020 is on track to get here is a big win
Andrew Yang is a fucking moron who isn't going to campaign to beat Bernie in his home state of New York. People dying from lack of healthcare doesn't mean no one is going to vote for him. Period.

Andrew Yang is going after Bernie Sanders? Yes, but it's a bit different than where Bernie is going and the media and establishment have been calling out his campaign. You can't even criticize the policies and policies that actually help millions of people.

Andrew Yang is my guy tonight and I'm excited. @USER
Andrew Yang is one of the last people in the race who actually has a chance to beat Trump.

Andrew Yang is a fucking billionaire.

Andrew Yang is in New Hampshire on June 15-24!!! I can't wait to get my vote for Yang in our Primary! :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:

Andrew Yang is making some changes this time around, but his approach to funding education is actually kind of bizarre and he's not my 1st choice in 2020.
Andrew Yang is the candidate for the American people, not the Donald Trump, McConnell or the GOP. He is the candidate that will make America strong, and free.

Andrew Yang is running for president but his campaign website would suggest he is a Democratic Socialist.

Andrew Yang is amazing and I'm here for it.

Andrew Yang is making a difference and will give an incredible speech on this important topic.
Andrew Yang is gonna beat Trump. I still think he's gonna be better than Trump, but I kinda hope not.
Andrew Yang isn't running for president because he's a white male billionaire. That is the problem with your narrative, @USER. He's running as a white male billionaire because he doesn't have any experience in public service. He
Andrew Yang is about our time as long as we are able to do the work of getting him out in the voting.
Andrew Yang is a white supremacist and a traitor.
Andrew Yang is definitely not going to take us on a path that we all need to accept. #YangTango
Andrew Yang is the only one who understands the complexities of the pandemic. You don't just say it's a hoax. We need to be prepared to take action. We gotta be prepared for what will happen.
Andrew Yang isn't a billionaire and his taxes aren't public record.

Andrew Yang is the Yang I need and I know she won't give it.
Andrew Yang is the best candidate we can hope for
Andrew Yang is the only answer that makes sense. He knows how to fix problems and is the ONLY candidate that would be good for the middle class right now. If anyone is ever going to convince me all it is going to be Biden or Bloomberg I

Andrew Yang is still a good president, I think that's the most important thing right now.
Andrew Yang is not Yang.

Andrew Yang is a Republican, right? That's the most important thing to hear when we talk politics.
Andrew Yang is our chance to stand up to the most corrupt, dishonest president in history, and get it done. If we aren't united, we keep being divided.
Andrew Yang is the candidate I'm most excited to vote for this election. I 'll vote for a man with a backbone and a plan to fight for all of us, that's not a man I'm afraid to cross the border
Andrew Yang is just one more corporate con artist pretending to be an old black guy in politics to bring attention to his campaign contributions.
Andrew Yang is amazing and I will forever support him, but he needs to change his mind about not holding his breath while #MedicareForAll is being debated and debated in the senate.
Andrew Yang is the Yang Gang candidate for UBI :grinning_face_with_sweat:
Andrew Yang is on Twitter, so I couldn't say more. :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Andrew Yang is a better man than this. He's the only candidate in the race who has had a real chance to do something that's meaningful for working families. If we nominate him to be the Democratic nominee, we 'll have made
Andrew Yang is the best thing we've done in the past 10 years, and we need every person who agrees with him on that issue to join us.
Andrew Yang is the only Democrat in the Democratic leadership who knows the proper way forward on this topic. And I like how you show @USER that not everyone has been able to figure this out before. #Yang2020
Andrew Yang is a great example of how a person can be a good man who cares deeply about the people, but will make sure their communities vote like an honorable servant. I'm proud he's speaking for us. #YangGang
Andrew Yang isn't too far off it. Not just because he seems like he should drop out, but also because most of the Yangs who have dropped out already are actually going to be very, very hard core Yang supporters.
Andrew Yang is a racist too :face_with_crossed-out_eyes: #DemDebate2020
Andrew Yang is a traitor. I don't like Bernie or Yang, nor Bernie's positions on trade, immigration, or education.

Andrew Yang is making this argument...
Andrew Yang is the only candidate I trust. What do I know? 🤷🏾‍♂

Andrew Yang is such a good candidate I'm going to be a bit concerned about where he ends up :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

Andrew Yang is a terrible candidate because he isn't an elected president, he's a fucking Russian troll. You are better with your words.
Andrew Yang isn't here, but I respect him. If you know him personally, you can ask him about it. He is genuinely a gentleman ( or a gentleman maybe? ) who doesn't treat his guests like people. He does not
Andrew Yang is my # 1! Don't let that negative negativity ruin everything. #Yang2020
Andrew Yang is coming for you next election.

Andrew Yang is coming for you in the fall. :grinning_face_with_sweat: If you have your own idea of how to raise capital from donors, here's the trick. The only way to do it right is to
Andrew Yang is running for president. He's a smart, compassionate guy. I agree with him on a lot of critical issues, but I really don't think Joe makes enough sense either. He is very ill suited as a senator, and

Andrew Yang is not going to drop out at 8 pm.
Andrew Yang is one of the few candidates who has been consistent for 40 years, and has spent his adult life building a coalition of working class and wealthy Democrats. Warren has no such consistency, is a progressive in ways Yang clearly doesn't. (

Andrew Yang is a great communicator but isn't it kind of ironic that she isn't really talking about how terrible things are for her as an elected official? That seems awfully out of character for someone who is leading a movement in this country
Andrew Yang is the only candidate I know that doesn't call themselves a capitalist and don't think universal basic income is good yet. It gets to that point.
Andrew Yang is a billionaire, who, along with the billionaires who donated their tax dollars to his campaign and enabled him to become such a beacon of hope and stability it would be one hundred percent unsurprising to see him become this divisive clown.

Andrew Yang is the best. He should lead our country, he deserves it.
