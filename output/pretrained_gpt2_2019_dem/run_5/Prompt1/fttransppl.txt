transgender people. As a trans woman, I'm constantly challenged and threatened with violence and shame for my gender status. I'm not anti trans. I'm just pro people who choose not to be trans.
transgender people's'right to exist.'I think it's important for both LGBTQ & cis - allies to speak up, but not to be erased.
transgender people!
transgender people don't use gender neutral pronouns in every other way. Also, please stop making people feel like they're somehow going to decide who deserves this rights and who needs it.
