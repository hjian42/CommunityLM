the Democratic Party needs to stop embracing identity politics and recognize that this isn't about the party platform ; it's about the survival of the party.
the Democratic Party needs to be dismantled, let it be. #TeamJoe :blue_heart: ‚úäüèº
the Democratic Party, and why in a democracy would they continue to support them? Because at least you're willing to admit that they're wrong, correct?
the Democratic Party has turned their backs on every one of its Democratic members ‚Äî every single one ‚Äî ever since they took over the Congress in 1991. This is an assault on the party and it's reputation as the Party of ‚Äú compromise. ÔøΩ
the Democratic Party. Now do Donald Trump, Don the Con, and his entire Cult.
the Democratic Party platform. It is a very complicated and critical issue, but it should be a priority for the Democratic Party and for my country. We can't stop Trump from winning it in 2020, and we don't know any better.
the Democratic Party is just a bunch of men and women trying to please each other.
the Democratic Party must have been afraid of Bernie. Warren is exactly the opposite. There's nothing inherently wrong with either of them, there's nothing inherently wrong with the other.
the Democratic Party is going to win over a large segment of African American voters in 2020, and we can get through a rigged primary.
the Democratic Party does not really want the Democratic Party to be the party.
the Democratic Party. It is only the party that has a right-wing movement and a left wing party. It's not the Party you see on TV. Not sure how it can be separated from the DSA. And I'm not
the Democratic Party is to run as an independent party. The Democratic Party would lose it's way with that. I wouldn't consider them an independent party

the Democratic Party is the most corrupt in the history of our country.
the Democratic Party, if you ask me...
the Democratic Party of Trump. That party is toxic.
the Democratic Party.
the Democratic Party has been completely destroyed by the Republican party.
the Democratic Party had been too silent about Bernie Sanders as well, but no one is saying that the Democratic Party has learned a lesson from 2016.
the Democratic Party is the party of identity politics. To me, that means voting for candidates who support the policies that best advance our values, to prioritize issues of justice, fairness, and equality for all. #RunBernieRunForSomething

the Democratic Party establishment really out here giving her a pass on this nonsense.
the Democratic Party. That's what's been going on for the last 4 years.
the Democratic Party should make it so, in 2020
the Democratic Party's long standing policy of never ending corporate influence -
the Democratic Party establishment's position is to not support and promote a candidate of the opposite party.
the Democratic Party's new strategy is about to begin. Now is the time to do far better than those around him. #NY24 '
the Democratic Party should be able to give more than one candidate the same amount of time to speak.
the Democratic Party of 2020 is going to need a lot of smart women.
the Democratic Party :
the Democratic Party's strategy and behavior over the last 50 years has been to create an anti-democratic party and its policies. Trump and the GOP have made clear that this is exactly what they want.
the Democratic Party shouldn't just run our nominee, but start with someone else and get people to back a candidate who they think will go the best way forward. We shouldn't just settle on a nominee ; we need a candidate who will take
the Democratic Party isn't. Stop being so dumb
the Democratic Party of our great #RutgersDems and our great allies.

the Democratic Party is too stupid and weak. They will NEVER win because Trump is a crook

the Democratic Party that was going to stop Sanders was not going to stop him.
the Democratic Party's only chance to defeat Trump. In 2020, let the party's diversity shine through.
the Democratic Party should end by not nominating these people.
the Democratic Party should have the first amendment with regard to the media and social media. This is a lie. This is wrong. It makes me feel bad for the people of Flint.

the Democratic Party is an outlier but it is an outlier. In the US, it's called ‚Äú centrist. ‚Äù
the Democratic Party, you shouldn't feel bad for our progressive future and I'm sorry you felt that way.
the Democratic Party is not even allowed to run, it's called the GOP. It represents the people.
the Democratic Party will make more enemies in the near-term...
the Democratic Party must now embrace the left's ideas and embrace its history. The left is not now.
the Democratic Party, I love and applaud you for your efforts to protect the Democratic Party, you did great. Your words are meaningless! You will go down in history as the dumbest person ever.
the Democratic Party has failed America.
the Democratic Party is NOT a party of the working class. It represents the worst and the worst working class ever was in the 1920s before slavery. When MLK Jr spoke...
the Democratic Party's long standing defense - the ‚Äú Left ‚Äù is trying to turn out every voter to back Biden.
the Democratic Party and the Democratic party have done nothing to get rid of the president, but haven't done much of anything about the President's actual misconduct.

the Democratic Party is not a viable democracy. Do you want to work with Russia to elect another authoritarian? Do you want to work with Russia to help elect Trump? I'm not supporting you because you have a platform.
the Democratic Party is not going to survive the general election.
the Democratic Party. The party to beat Donald Trump is to defeat Mitch McConnell.
the Democratic Party, for which it stands, never will.
the Democratic Party, the GOP, the DNC, and the White House... they're simply voting with their money!
the Democratic Party is going to get dragged so badly if they lose in November. If the Democrats don't nominate a progressive, he 'll get lost again in 2020. The voters want progressive policy, and they will do their votes. Period.
the Democratic Party. ‚Äù If you think about it the same...
the Democratic Party is so far down the rabbit hole of a Trump campaign ad that it's painful to watch even the dumbest of his supporters not realize they're being helped by an algorithm.
the Democratic Party? Don't miss his interview with @USER on Thursday at 6 p.m. EDT or watch online :

the Democratic Party doesn't count.
the Democratic Party is the most racist party in the country,
the Democratic Party isn't running for President because women are the only viable and effective voices in Congress? Oh, no, maybe. ( I guess I would take the latter than the former. )
the Democratic Party is doing all it can to ensure that a nominee who isn't white does not receive the nomination. There are a lot of us that would rather vote for a black woman rather than a mediocre white male. That has to stop.
the Democratic Party
the Democratic Party is in trouble, not just w / us, but with Trump -
the Democratic Party, are doing with their lives for the benefit of others. We can not stop them from the polls. And they keep failing by their own incompetence & cruelty.
the Democratic Party of the future. What do they have to lose? I think they will still be there because of the people who support them.
the Democratic Party is currently engaged in the most rigged and rigged election ever.
the Democratic Party. You are the worst party out there, as a former Republican you suck
the Democratic Party as a whole. The party was built without progressive policies.
the Democratic Party.
the Democratic Party isn't that much better at the things that are good than you are at the things you really like.
the Democratic Party needs to make a very strong case. If not, its time the party's membership voted with their own interests and the interests of the country.
the Democratic Party is going to be better off going the centrist route of Trump and his cult.
the Democratic Party and Democratic politicians are going to end up with a white male with questionable morals and an inability to understand math? I'm tired of Bernie supporters saying ‚Äú I'm not anti-Hillary. ‚Äù

the Democratic Party must be destroyed from the inside out. That is what the left is fighting against.
the Democratic Party is a criminal enterprise. The only people who can win by running are the ones who put the country above party and want you to stay in office. You're a criminal enterprise. It's your fault if someone says that again
