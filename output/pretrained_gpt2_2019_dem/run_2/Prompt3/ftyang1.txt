Andrew Yang is a total phony, like your President Trump. He only cares about himself. If you support him, then you're an empty suit. I hope Yangs voters make it to the polls.

Andrew Yang is a very nice man, and a big Bernie supporter, but at this point isn't he the leader we need? Or should I say the one we need? Biden? No way, but I guess this will take some staying power
Andrew Yang is a progressive, he is not a Trump. He is a moderate who will allow Biden to run as a centrist, but he is not a Trump

Andrew Yang is a terrible candidate. If anyone should be worried about Yang they should be focusing on getting a second term of Trump out. There is no “ way ” Trump would win the Dems. If they are so concerned they should be worried

Andrew Yang is a great person, but the way he communicates his ideology with no apparent logic has me shook. No one is allowed to take a joke. We can talk about any topic and he talks about stuff his ideas don't help.
Andrew Yang is a great guy but his actions in relation to that, with even trying to talk over him, shows a lack of self-awareness or understanding of his own work and his political goals.
Andrew Yang is a great talker, but his ideas about free stuff are very much in opposition to the way we 'd want free things to be. But he's the kind of politician that most of y'all give a shit about.
