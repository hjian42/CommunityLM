Hispanic people are more likely to take in less money and have more poor lives than white people.
Hispanic people are underrepresented, and the percentage is increasing. Here's why :
Hispanic people are NOT being discriminated against. The point of a border security fence is NOT only to stop the immigration of invaders but also deter illegal immigration as well.
Hispanic people are the ones committing crimes & creating this mess.
Hispanic people are being exterminated! You are a joke!
Hispanic people are much smaller than the general population by nearly 10 percent of the population - - where is the media?
