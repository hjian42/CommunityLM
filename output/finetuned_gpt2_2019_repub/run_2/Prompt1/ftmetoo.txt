the #MeToo movement is just another attempt to normalize the sexualization of men to women. It doesn't fit the narrative, but it's doing its best to keep it alive.
the #MeToo movement is to stop the harassment of women like the rest of them. But it's okay if you can't be both? So glad you're joining us @USER
the #MeToo movement is the #WalkAway movement. It's a movement that I have no desire to end. I love all men to be a great advocate for truth and justice in the justice system!! #StandWithRaymond
the #MeToo movement, but no doubt, a huge part of the problem is people still can't accept they still can't accept women are not equals, and they can't accept how good looking they are.
the #MeToo movement.
the #MeToo movement and we are now all looking to the future?! @USER
the #MeToo movement? I'm thinking that's what I am going for.
the #MeToo movement? We know you wanted her to be a victim. You need to find another story. #ProLifeSTL
the #MeToo movement. They have tried so hard to demonize men of any other skin color but you know what they don't want you to see? They don't want you to see their hypocrisy.
the #MeToo movement is a huge distraction. If you are a victim, you really need a mental health professional.
the #MeToo movement has been around a while. We have had lots of stories about the abuses of men around the world, but we also have those stories about their personal stories. Maybe men should seek help before they do, and not just talk
the #MeToo movement started in the 60's when women were being forced to wear dresses or skirts and then the trend grew.
the #MeToo movement continues on with no repercussions whatsoever. And then @USER is suspended for his support of abortion. I think @USER realizes the damage he's done
the #MeToo movement - it's disgusting and wrong, but it's also just getting started.

the #MeToo movement is about to get much bigger. @USER talks with @USER at 6:30 p.m. to discuss why the people of Minnesota should be worried...
the #MeToo movement, with the exception of a few, is so far gone and I really wish they would make some good change. I was just curious if they might be willing to pay the $ 12k for a new suit.
the #MeToo movement has created a #parade where #victimization happens in #prison #rejection. The victims are now free to speak out and support their victims'rights.
the #MeToo movement continues...

the #MeToo movement and then the #SCOTUS ruling that the ACA was unconstitutional.

the #MeToo movement. The only thing keeping the left from taking over is your platform
the #MeToo movement continues.
the #MeToo movement via @USER
the #MeToo movement in Washington, DC. He's in his office with a lot of empty suits. It's almost like he's just not gonna run for President.
the #MeToo movement has created an environment where women don't have their right to the ultimate expression of their body however we choose to express it freely. It has caused people to believe that they don't have a right to make them their

the #MeToo movement has begun in New York City
the #MeToo movement is a terrible choice and has been abused from the beginning. #AbortionIsProAbortion #prolifers #ProLifeIsProWoman

the #MeToo movement, a group of survivors of rape and sexual abuse have been organizing a campaign to bring awareness to the issue of forced sterilization by ‚Äú gay ‚Äù men, a growing movement among survivors of sexual abuse and sexual abuse.
the #MeToo movement : I should have more of a say on this #MeToo issue via @USER #gender #genderidentity #womensissues
the #MeToo movement has been nothing short of an abomination. Let that sink in for a little while...
the #MeToo movement. This will not end well for me.
the #MeToo movement has become an epic fail to normalize and normalize every single thing about this kind of thing. What's sad is they think we are stupid or just idiots
the #MeToo movement.
the #MeToo movement has had a devastating impact on the young. Our hope is that as a result of these stories and efforts, young will grow, and we 'll help them face the challenges that threaten their futures. #PamelaC
the #MeToo movement isn't new here. There is a movement to say that sexual behavior can be normalized to prevent childhood sexual assault in school and other public settings.
the #MeToo movement has got to stop. #feminismisracist
the #MeToo movement is dead. Now it's about trying to cover one of the big ones : anti-semitism. @USER

the #MeToo movement will make it more difficult for feminists to tell men they don't exist ( as feminists should ).
the #MeToo movement is a cult. But it has never looked worse. #JussieSmollett, #MAGA and the #Klan movement are just as bad, it doesn't matter which one. I can't figure out
the #MeToo movement #bumpstock #hallowen #MeToo
the #MeToo movement is only for ‚Äú woke ‚Äù conservatives, and we need to stop this from happening. #WakeUpAmerica
the #MeToo movement is in full swing!
the #MeToo movement : #TENvsCLE
the #MeToo movement hasn't come around ( and the reason for it is because of people like @USER who claim that women who tell them they won't date men are men ).
the #MeToo movement. @USER and I are so grateful for you @USER! Thank You!
the #MeToo movement is a giant, huge mistake. @USER did better than @USER, and she got caught, by a bunch of assholes. @USER didn't apologize. You lost. Now you've lost your platform.
the #MeToo movement. #WomenForTrump has gone off the rails.
the #MeToo movement, we've had many women lose their lives due to rape. These young ladies have taken so many steps to raise awareness of this injustice while doing so. This is so wrong.
the #MeToo movement.
the #MeToo movement.
the #MeToo movement to silence the voices of women and minorities! So many of us are deeply concerned for the rights of minorities and women of faith that are at stake!

the #MeToo movement ( with a name we've never heard of )
the #MeToo movement but she was raised this way. So I feel your pain?
the #MeToo movement - #Rapper #Miley Cyrus and actor #Sandra Bullock are suing the #film giant over a lawsuit claiming they were pressured or coerced into performing a sexual act.
the #MeToo movement is getting more and more out of every woman's hand - from my friends at Geller Report and for good reason. I've gotten to the point that, despite the obvious flaws, all men are human, even

the #MeToo movement.
the #MeToo movement started by a man who was accused and fired by a former #Dallas police officer due to allegations of sexual harassment ( from @USER )
the #MeToo movement, you were obviously triggered by @USER's words. Just go away.
the #MeToo movement is nothing new.
the #MeToo movement is turning into the Trump haters'only hope.
the #MeToo movement is the product of liberals, and the #MeToo movement is also the product of liberals. There are two groups of people who are most likely to do the most dirty work... the media, and conservatives.
the #MeToo movement to the left!
the #MeToo movement is the very reason the left has lost their ever expanding voter base. It would make sense for them to start the process over from scratch!
the #MeToo movement.
the #MeToo movement is about women getting the right to vote. #abortion should be no law but to murder a baby. You're defending a child's life that was born in rape.
the #MeToo movement.
the #MeToo movement, to bring men back into the public eye, they must take a personal look at how our culture has twisted them and twisted the world around them.

the #MeToo movement is a joke. It's a pathetic attempt to destroy every woman, every person in every social group and every political party. It's what gets these people elected.. and it's the same thing every election.
the #MeToo movement.
the #MeToo movement
the #MeToo movement continues tonight, as the Democratic party is the new standard bearer and only thing that will change in 2020 - - Joe Biden.

the #MeToo movement, because it's not only sexist for men ‚Äî it's not even funny. And it's sexist because it's a lie, and it's a lie. @USER @USER @USER
the #MeToo movement of the 20th century.
the #MeToo movement is a huge fraud. There's nothing better than having someone with a bad attitude who acts like a child or something. I feel bad for people who have an attitude such as that. The world is not that cruel.
the #MeToo movement, and you find it's not a real movement right?
the #MeToo movement was only going to slow things down.
the #MeToo movement - - but I don't believe you are in the US, and will not join them in demanding she resign after she is brought before House Committee on Ethics.
the #MeToo movement, the first time @USER & I spoke at a conference on sexual misconduct in the workplace, which he was not privy to in the beginning. It's amazing how many people have come to him & changed their ways
the #MeToo movement was more than it came in. The manosphere and politics itself are just one example of the problem.
the #MeToo movement is one where the right to be heard and defended is being eroded in an increasingly digital age.
the #MeToo movement is a perfect example of why we need #truth, accountability, and accountability.
the #MeToo movement couldn't find a more effective reason...
the #MeToo movement is being promoted and embraced by progressives.
the #MeToo movement! #KAG2020
the #MeToo movement will likely be the last stand as this #MeToo accuser has no evidence of any abuse or abuse of power. That is a fact.
the #MeToo movement is an example that #TheLeft can take no #Prayers if they don't care for you. The people will #Walkaway from the Leftist #hypocrisy and just embrace the #MAGAKids
the #MeToo movement, and this is a sad picture. So there's that. We're moving in the right direction.
the #MeToo movement. #truth
the #MeToo movement started off as a joke with jokes about rape and abuse being reported on, I am not surprised to find out some of these women do not want any of them to ever ever call for resignation. These ladies are such hypocrites
the #MeToo movement is the least of which is a culture of sexual harassment.
the #MeToo movement ‚Äî here are six real signs to keep in mind ( via @USER ):

the #MeToo movement to silence Conservatives and promote feminism, writes @USER via @USER
the #MeToo movement that didn't end with HRC
the #MeToo movement could become even more consequential.
the #MeToo movement has gotten so old, so petty, so boring, it's hard to tell who actually cares about this stuff. Not one single one. Most ppl have to deal with it. We need to move on.
the #MeToo movement at its finest. Sad.
the #MeToo movement, and he wants to get rid of the electoral college so the @USER and the @USER can have the popular vote, which should be used to eliminate every single one of them. #WalkawayAOC
the #MeToo movement. How to make your own tea.
the #MeToo movement is a sham for #MAGA. They are the ones hurting women and their families

the #MeToo movement is no different. You've chosen to silence a voice that matters ( even if it's a Democrat ).
the #MeToo movement is about...
the #MeToo movement has no chance of working, only it makes it worse. You hate women and make them happy. I'm disappointed. I'm a woman of color. I'm sick of it. I'm sick.
the #MeToo movement continues. Why are we getting threats online and not doing anything about it?
the #MeToo movement. ( She actually just had a little of my own to say about it. )
the #MeToo movement is now the largest issue of the year. A new national coalition of @USER partners is pressing the state legislature to pass a pro-harassment, marriage, and parental rights act that says :

the #MeToo movement is not going to be the end of the Democrat party.
the #MeToo movement
the #MeToo movement needs your support.
the #MeToo movement is coming into full swing. A lot of it is rooted in the idea that women are victims on the inside and the men are victims on the outside. And I think women should speak to people in general as they 'd
the #MeToo movement has now reached its peak, where the movement is seen as a victim on the other side of an actual event and seen as evil.

the #MeToo movement will soon include a video of someone saying you're trans

the #MeToo movement... :upside-down_face: :upside-down_face: :winking_face: :winking_face:
the #MeToo movement is disgusting, if you think about it, it's very sad & sad. They are literally making people victims. All of you that support them, look at where it's coming from & if it's going
the #MeToo movement. I believe you are right, so we can not be too far removed from truth.
the #MeToo movement is on a roll. I can't emphasize enough how dangerous this whole thing is.
the #MeToo movement isn't about truth, but making it into propaganda for their own, the only way the lefties will make it look good is by using #metoo to make those same people think it's too woke
the #MeToo movement on twitter. He's been on social media for 20 years.
the #MeToo movement was trending in 2017 when women were finally told it was okay to use force against them? What happened?
the #MeToo movement in America. It's sad to see how many people can't see that our media has become the enabler of this cycle
the #MeToo movement started right after @USER's book, and it's gaining momentum.
the #MeToo movement has gotten in the way of the real victims of sex trafficking. This is nothing new, the problem is that sex trafficking thrives on the idea that someone isn't worth being trafficked.
the #MeToo movement must be stopped.
the #MeToo movement wasn't about empowering girls to do bad things - it was about empowering the ones who have abused them, not allowing any consequences. #MeTooCensorship

the #MeToo movement.
the #MeToo movement started because of a very young girl and the left is so ignorant and evil.
the #MeToo movement in the liberal-dominated media. It also encourages and inspires this type of behavior.
the #MeToo movement has been really effective in getting men to stop the false accusations against them, because it isn't about them.
the #MeToo movement is an attack on women's rights. Women are human. They are not human, nor capable of holding a productive conversation. I believe they are capable of an even greater role in society, not vice versa.
the #MeToo movement isn't going anywhere, and I don't know anything about it ( and I hope you're not )!!

the #MeToo movement is not going to stop until women are recognized for their role in exposing pedo-licking - - - and men being paid to do the same. These videos are not the same as the men behind the scenes.
the #MeToo movement is #sexist. There is a serious difference between men and women, and I'm here to tell it with #WomenForTrump and #Democrats against that. Let's be reasonable and not make it an issue
the #MeToo movement. These women have been assaulted and harassed, and have filed complaint.
the #MeToo movement - - or has she become a victim of sexism?
the #MeToo movement, that is so bad when it comes to being a woman. I wish they did that to the left too. What has they done, or done, to deserve to go to jail? How about they shut up?
the #MeToo movement, the #MeToo movement, the #MeToo movement, whatever. You are the ones who are wrong. :winking_face:

the #MeToo movement.
the #MeToo movement is making such an impact even as it's taken away of the very best, the very people who have to deal with it and their own people. This must stop. This is going to sound ridiculous, but in reality
the #MeToo movement. We would prefer we just make up stories and not tell the whole story. #Truth #TheBachelor
the #MeToo movement continues. This person has a history of being a douchebag. He's not a very good reporter. I want to see them sue him for defamation.

the #MeToo movement just don't feel like you have to make excuses. It's not like we're all just going to get along for the life of the party.
the #MeToo movement. The difference is that some feminists are far more offended by this than others.

the #MeToo movement and the culture of rape and pedophilia. Why do we continue to let the world shame us in this way. A very few men are now rapists. It can be said that is the greatest sin in our world and that
the #MeToo movement, which targets certain sexual identity groups.
