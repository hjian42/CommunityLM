feminists and how to not be a victim of the patriarchy
feminists would say they don't want women to have reproductive decisions about what men do, like you dont want to have to be a woman to know who your wife is.

feminists can't be bothered with and do nothing to dismantle the white power patriarchy that is patriarchy. If we weren't living in a place like this, then how are we all supposed to know?
