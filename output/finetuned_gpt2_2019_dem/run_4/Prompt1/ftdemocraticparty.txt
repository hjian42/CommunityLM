the Democratic Party needs to wake up. The party has lost its moral compass. Republicans know Trump did nothing wrong but don't care. The GOP knows they just wanted this to work ; they did nothing wrong ‚Äî they just don't care.
the Democratic Party was the most diverse and fair system in American history. And this is an important lesson for people who are working together on campaigns.

the Democratic Party is so fucked by their own party because it represents America instead of the people. It's a damn shame that nobody can be elected to anything on earth. #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica
the Democratic Party shouldn't have to choose between the two. I think it depends what kind of candidate they like in office. And in the first place, the Democrats ( not Republicans ) shouldn't get to choose between two highly placed candidates.

the Democratic Party is going to flip to Trump in November. He will have no path to victory if Democrats keep this house.

the Democratic Party has become a political party of the oligarchy. They only care about the wealth, power, and control, and only care about money.
the Democratic Party has spent decades propagating racism in the American psyche. Trump seems to have made it his mission ( to make himself look bad by speaking out against such injustices ).
the Democratic Party wants the people to decide their president. There isn't any other way to do that so there's no real debate. We're not at this point as the people want to decide.

the Democratic Party should have a party for all of its members, but not just the ones you've been in the party too. It should be something more like the Progressive PARTY or DNP.

the Democratic Party needs to start saying he doesn't need to get off his ass. There isn't a damn way he should. What about the millions of folks in his pocket he has siphoned off by spreading his lies? Stop.

the Democratic Party needs to keep fighting for what's right and stop pretending that these are just people who want to give back to their community and not take advantage of the policies of big business to continue to hoard money and power of their favorite billionaire.

the Democratic Party could not get their shit together if their candidate was not Warren or Sanders. I just feel like Warren is the only one who truly understands where the Democratic Party is heading.
the Democratic Party needs to make them feel better and be more vocal now about their complicity
the Democratic Party, which has endorsed Bernie Sanders for president in the last two weeks, is holding a fundraiser for a political committee led by Biden, the most experienced and experienced candidate in the race.
the Democratic Party has been on the road for 4 years, but the DNC really wanted to make the rules seem fair today... what... no.
the Democratic Party will elect another President if Bernie Sanders becomes the nominee. ( I'm in California and I saw the same story in Wisconsin and Michigan, both places Biden is projected to win the GE. )
the Democratic Party establishment should stay away from ‚Äò the party of the people'‚Äî as they've done in Vermont, Washington, Michigan, Florida and Texas. ‚Äù
the Democratic Party ( DSA ) does not have a chance to win a general. The only way to get it done is to nominate a progressive VP to beat Trump. The most serious Democratic candidate is Bernie Sanders.

the Democratic Party. The Republican Party has made a grave mistake. The country is not a business, it has no business in politics, it would like a new vision of democracy instead of the party which is the party of fascism but not democracy.
