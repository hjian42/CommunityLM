Elizabeth Warren is a candidate who hasn't addressed my concerns about her political beliefs or her platform, and that's okay. I want a more progressive progressive, who can actually implement his policies. Not just Sanders.
Elizabeth Warren is a woman and will be a great president.
Elizabeth Warren is a badass. She's also the first American ever to ever hold the title of Vice President.

Elizabeth Warren is a corporate Democrat. They 'll keep pushing her. Not sure who will support her ( I personally like the idea of a woman running for office. But I don't think she's an effective politician. ) And it '
Elizabeth Warren is a disgrace. I wish Bernie ( the one who has a heart attack ) would show up and kick trump in the face.
Elizabeth Warren is a liar. She claims she wouldn't do that with Bernie and that's why she switched parties to back her.

Elizabeth Warren is a national treasure. Keep up the good work. #TeamWarren #Warren2020 :blue_heart: :water_wave:

Elizabeth Warren is a real one! She had a major breakthrough in this race.
Elizabeth Warren is a national treasure. I wish I lived closer but now I live in DC
Elizabeth Warren is a perfect fit in the 2020 Democratic presidential field
Elizabeth Warren is a woman. Period. Her statement against M4A does not apply here and was poorly phrased. But she's a progressive for whom she has her own agenda that appeals to voters.
Elizabeth Warren is a liar, an unethical, theocracy. I like that Biden thinks the #ClimateCrisis is a hoax, but we need to find out #MedicareForAll, #GreenNewDeal, #HealthCare4All.
Elizabeth Warren is a great candidate that I like that she isn't a Republican, but there are people out there who want to cut taxes and make sure more people don't have to.
Elizabeth Warren is a master legislator for working class, Black, POC communities on everything from transit to climate change #SheThePeople2020 #SheThePeople2020
Elizabeth Warren is a progressive. Bernie Sanders is a centrist. The two are the same. And neither are going to win a single primary and therefore need a broad coalition of supporters. Only the moderate voters are going to flip to the right.

Elizabeth Warren is a racist pig with a big ass platform. It's obvious she was inspired by the alt-right.

Elizabeth Warren is a neoliberal. As I like to state publicly, Bernie is not a Dem.
Elizabeth Warren is a fucking tool.
Elizabeth Warren is a bad candidate who attacks people on their sexuality and identity. The point of Biden is that his message of inclusion and inclusive is not just platitudes. It's a message of hope and understanding. That's why I support Kam
Elizabeth Warren is a hero ( and I wish I could go by that one ) #DemDebate
Elizabeth Warren is a great progressive who will work with the people to improve our country.
Elizabeth Warren is a very strong candidate running for President. I think she will resonate with those who have been working hard and are ready to be more than pawns to those who need their help. This is going to be a tough debate.
Elizabeth Warren is a horrible senator and a horrible politician. But this is the way they should be doing it.
Elizabeth Warren is a woman. She runs with the values of the Democratic Party, and she's running against a president who abuses their power. Trump can't be trusted.
Elizabeth Warren is a fucking idiot who thinks Bernie Bros are sexist when they are literally the ones attacking Bernie.
Elizabeth Warren is a true hero and I truly hope she's a woman running for President. Please vote for @USER, you're really getting some serious ground to cover when elected.

Elizabeth Warren is a real, unifying woman. I hope she takes all the votes and wins the nomination. Period.
Elizabeth Warren is a liar and a sexual abuser.
Elizabeth Warren is a liar. I'm all about taking names and shaming other liars. She knows better, and her actions could get her into the Senate.

Elizabeth Warren is a horrible candidate and a terrible representative of the Democratic Party.
Elizabeth Warren is a true feminist. We can not afford a sexist white man that does not know their shit.

Elizabeth Warren is a very good political strategist. I think she nailed it.
Elizabeth Warren is a great American... and it's probably just because she has a heart and knows what she's doing.
Elizabeth Warren is a progressive who could win and actually win New York.
Elizabeth Warren is a corporate sellout and only cares about protecting corporate power, not working people. She's the only candidate I trust.
Elizabeth Warren is a fucking treasure and I am so happy that people will now start calling out this trash in this election cycle. If you are not concerned about these people being mean, how is it that you are not concerned about what happens to them?
Elizabeth Warren is a liar and a Russian asset. #Resist #WomensRights

Elizabeth Warren is a fighter. A woman has to fight for the policies she believes in. It's not rocket science but it's something that is worth doing. @USER #WarrenForTheWin
Elizabeth Warren is a candidate who can bring a good deal of the country together and unite us. She's not the last candidate I 'd support.

Elizabeth Warren is a liar to the left of Bernie Sanders
Elizabeth Warren is a liar and a racist. She just doesn't have my support don't @USER me
Elizabeth Warren is a brilliant woman who can bring change and unity to the presidential field. We need her - - especially, of course, this time. Let's just say I 'd rather watch the Super Tuesday debates instead.
Elizabeth Warren is a great friend for sure. But this isn't unique to Warren and the DNC establishment. The Sanders campaign wasn't given access to Hillary Clinton, and it's not because they were paid to do so. #ElizabethWarren
Elizabeth Warren is a hero for the good of the people. We should demand she take action on climate change.
Elizabeth Warren is a traitor, and the GOP Senate would be happy to impeach her. But I say it in the long-run... because we need her too.
Elizabeth Warren is a liar, does not know what a government will look like, does not support women, and can NOT answer the very basic questions Republicans asked before the race.
Elizabeth Warren is a liar and a fraud and has never been qualified to be POTUS. Anyone who can't take her advice is an idiot. #Vote
Elizabeth Warren is a wonderful and necessary candidate!
Elizabeth Warren is a good pick IMO. She's too hawkish with her foreign policy and can't stand up for the LGBTQ community. She's good at using the military to attack our enemies. Bernie's a bad ass.
Elizabeth Warren is a great example of what that word means.
Elizabeth Warren is a woman who has done more for black women than Bernie Sanders has did for Democrats! And I voted for Biden when Warren was running, no matter what. And by the way, where did you vote or what candidate is your fave
Elizabeth Warren is a liar. She is a liar. I have been telling you why. The time has come! Let's end this bullshit!

Elizabeth Warren is a war monger. She thinks war is acceptable. That's a war crime. She wants a war wall.

Elizabeth Warren is a terrible way to say “ Bernie Sanders ”. She was never even an option.
Elizabeth Warren is a far better candidate than Jill Stein and Cory Booker. Don't buy into this crap.

Elizabeth Warren is a Senator that cares about our country and the future of this country is none of your business.

Elizabeth Warren is a horrible candidate we have the time and we need to get behind her.
