Andrew Yang is trying real hard to be more ‚Äú me ‚Äù in 2019.
Andrew Yang is literally taking money from billionaires and saying that his name isn't Yang and that the $ 10 million wasn't his money. Which is actually the entire reason why Yang should drop out.

Andrew Yang isn't a Democrat and he's not an asshole. He's really just a corporate, neoliberal Democrat who thinks the economy is better by means of being more socialist so he wants his rich donors to tax and make everyone else pay

Andrew Yang is a brilliant human who gives no fucks. I appreciate it as much as anyone, and also recognize that his critique of Warren is very different from hers. But he has much to offer ‚Äî and that alone is worth it!
Andrew Yang is awesome... what else did I do this week besides watch the impeachment hearings?!
Andrew Yang is now my Senator, running the fight for the middle class. This is a great campaign. Go vote for these people to win in November and if you like what they have to say about policy you won't vote for sanders for

Andrew Yang is more than that and she is the candidate I care about for now. #DemDebate
Andrew Yang is one of those voices we need to be watching out for. The idea that he is a serious candidate and is going to bring change is the problem. I will never vote for Yang because he's not a Democrat. It is time
Andrew Yang is a national security hawk. My guess is he isn't quite that familiar with US foreign policy.
Andrew Yang is great at math. He's also very smart. It says a lot about how the world has changed, and how we're less resilient. He's also a leader of a movement that has mobilized millions of people.

Andrew Yang is not running? #YangGang
Andrew Yang is the only candidate running in my city. He has zero policy plans, and I support him in many respects. But, in this election, his politics / policy proposals are a threat to our democracy. #IowaCaucus #Iowa
Andrew Yang is a billionaire? WTF is wrong with people? You get some sort of prize for your stupidity then, @USER?
Andrew Yang is not, because if he were, he wouldn't support Pete's policies. And this is the only news source where Pete is consistently leading. It makes me hope he will endorse Bernie.

Andrew Yang is literally the one who made a career for himself
Andrew Yang is a piece of shit. #DemDebate
Andrew Yang is trying to play with Trump's ego and I think there's that. It's what he tries to do and he's trying to say, so I have to respect that.
Andrew Yang is a joke. You can bet that Yang is trying to get people to take on the status quo of corporate capitalism - which should get a bad rap from the right.
Andrew Yang is a fucking clown and not a millennial. #Yang2020
Andrew Yang is a fantastic communicator, but my main point is that she doesn't necessarily share ideas from this era, but doesn't necessarily dismiss them. If you disagree with her, don't trust her.

Andrew Yang is on the list too.
Andrew Yang is the reason that I didn't have any friends. All I know is what it feels like to be an old man.

Andrew Yang is my choice right now in the primary.
Andrew Yang is a huge problem for a lot of us
Andrew Yang is NOT the solution.

Andrew Yang is a smart, kind man. He's got a plan. I'm all for him moving to M4A, or at least M4A 2.0. #YangGang #M4A4ALL

Andrew Yang is the candidate for the Democratic primary. #yanggang
Andrew Yang is the only one I wouldn't rather have than Sanders in the White House than anyone else in the Democratic presidential field. @USER @USER @USER
Andrew Yang is also at this point my favorite and a very good example of the democratic establishment's role in ensuring the elites win. There are no rules for governing in this country. You can not govern.
Andrew Yang is a better version of Andrew McCabe I would love to see a second of him in the White House
Andrew Yang is also on the show. He 'd be a great leader.
Andrew Yang is so fucking bad, and I'm very pissed. If you actually believe Yang you better stand up to him or you're too stupid to know what his politics are. Like the old saying goes if you don't believe in

Andrew Yang is a good example of how to be the best candidate for women by not letting men pick which of us be the best for you.
Andrew Yang is the best candidate. Not sure if it would matter, but a lot of other people want to put him in the position of President. He's a solid VP.

Andrew Yang is a liar. So is Yang. So is Buttigieg.

Andrew Yang is my # 1 #YangGang favorite. He's made me feel better about my own life and I appreciate it.
Andrew Yang is a Bernie Gater, because he actually * is * not afraid of getting paid for his work ; he's only afraid of getting his own shit funded. He can't just say, ‚Äú my mommy said you are,
Andrew Yang is a traitor from his campaign and he is not interested in what the United States should do about it, because unlike Bernie, Trump is a genuine leader and unlike any other politician we have. It's not because he thinks his ideas are

Andrew Yang is running. Get involved.
Andrew Yang is not our hero.
Andrew Yang is not a smart businessman. His only hope is to bring back the old economy that is bleeding us so big. His plan will bring jobs back, it takes the money to even expand it. That's the only question.

Andrew Yang is running for president? I know we're trying to be fair but let me show you another way, what do you think is fair? As far as the people running, Yang is running for VP. Bernie is running for president.

Andrew Yang is the man from the early 90s ( but I've heard enough! ).

Andrew Yang is very much a voice for the right. My heart is with you.

Andrew Yang is my Mayor. We are going to need someone to unify and stand up for the people.
Andrew Yang is also a Bernie Bro, a white woman, and some asshole who voted against Hillary.

Andrew Yang is an interesting addition to a crowded field for the Democratic presidential nomination. Yang makes sense as somebody who cares a lot about how public education, especially public schools are funded, is covered, and will actually address income disparity.
Andrew Yang is a very dangerous guy
Andrew Yang is my new hero. We've had the same fight for the last 12 months. He's been the best, the most electable, and even the most charismatic candidate. Warren is like a dream come true. @USER #

Andrew Yang is an excellent resource and anyone can join him!
Andrew Yang is the man. He's so funny!

Andrew Yang is a perfect example of why we need to vote blue out.

Andrew Yang is the best in the game ‚Äî and a lot of people are mad.
Andrew Yang is one of the few candidates that gives the full debate to people who are already being attacked by the media or media. Yang could not do his usual stump speech, which is mostly scripted and doesn't make sense to anyone.

Andrew Yang is the most authentic and honest candidate to be inaugurated
Andrew Yang is a racist misogynist. He wants to take away our birthright. He's been saying it for years and he feels it necessary. We should be voting for #YangGang and not waiting for his supporters to say no when
Andrew Yang is gonna defeat Trump.
Andrew Yang is the only choice in November but he will vote to save us from ourselves and the worst things in America
Andrew Yang is the perfect candidate to put an end to the myth that the Democratic Party is divided into extremes by claiming people who agree with one candidate are not the same people who argue against the other.
Andrew Yang is a terrible candidate, an ineffective political class / establishment neoliberal that is utterly incapable of addressing our current crisis, or our current government's policies. There is no difference between him and his GOP cohorts. They are just afraid to attack.
Andrew Yang is at 3 % and I can't even get his name right without dropping his. But he's got a great idea for helping kids who really need college education.

Andrew Yang is talking about the future of the #FreedomDividend, but he hasn't said a lot about the potential for an economic floor of just taxing the rich for everyone.
Andrew Yang is a badass and a trailblazer. He doesn't need to be a front runner! #YangGang #YangForAmerica
Andrew Yang is not a Republican. He is a Democrat. And Yang is not an idiot. Which is why I am glad we are voting Joe.
Andrew Yang is a good guy, and I absolutely loved the campaign but I never got into it ( yet ). He could have been in favor of impeachment in past election years, but he's too corrupt to do that.
Andrew Yang is just trying to be a better politician. He's not trying to change things. He's doing it on behalf of the community, because in America we have billionaires. Bernie's doing it on behalf of the middle class.
Andrew Yang is a candidate who would transform the Democratic Party via @USER
Andrew Yang is a Democrat, not a Republican.

Andrew Yang is now running for president?

Andrew Yang is the best, but it would be nice if they stopped comparing a candidate's life to what is objectively good at the moment. No one is perfect, but the differences you see are the difference between what a candidate can accomplish, versus
