feminists are a fucking joke.
feminists are a plague.

feminists are a bunch of assholes.
feminists are a huge part of why white feminism is problematic.
feminists are a bad faith lot.
feminists are a minority ; the majority of us are feminists.
feminists are a cult. They believe that we are the lesser of the two evils while not actually being oppressed. They believe that everyone is a slave to certain people and all races are people.
feminists are a major factor this season.
feminists are a thing, you mean, and we need to stop treating them like they're part of our community to be civil? I believe we need to do better too.
feminists are a terrible bunch. This is a joke, but it happens everywhere, and I think, at this point, that no one here is remotely concerned by it.
feminists are a dime a dozen, so you shouldn't be surprised if y'all are the ones who take money from all the companies who cater to this type of narrative which you refuse to see.
feminists are a dangerous bunch, like the folks who want sex workers to be violent.
feminists are a problem and I'm sick of them harassing other people. How dare you speak for all of us. We all deserve equality. We all need to be equal with those in charge in our lives 🤷🏾�
feminists are a very different breed. But I'm a cisgender straight man and that means it. But I don't really get what you're trying to make.
feminists are a cult. I know this too well.
feminists are a bad faith and misogynistic outfit. ” I felt that. I feel like I have a choice of words, but I still feel like what this tweet meant was a way to mock me at some point.
feminists are a problem.
feminists are a toxic breed ; as such we feel they have rights to express themselves but not to act as gatekeeper for a whole race. 1/2
feminists are a threat. I'm a cis-phobic trans woman who never used to be attracted to other people. So I see no problem using that tactic.
feminists are a * * hole, but I see nothing hateful about them.
feminists are a bit much for some white folks as your comment further proves. So what is the issue here for you?
feminists are a bit much, but @USER nailed it with this piece about #Stonewall.
feminists are a lot like white supremacists so we shouldn't be surprised :eyes:
feminists are a lot of things! There's nothing sexy about them or any of them to begin with! They're just men in dresses and we're the main body entertainment! #feminism #curvywomen #curvywomen
feminists are a bunch of babies in their 20s, with women as their object. We are not to be blamed or forced to conform to that binary gender.
feminists are a fucking joke. I think a lot of them know how to write a coherent sentence. I'm not sure if the NYT is trolling, but there are a lot of right wing hacks who think they're the first ones calling
feminists are a white supremacist patriarchy.
feminists are a plague.
feminists are a big part of this. Some of mine just call them “ the left ” ( i. e., ‘ right-wing ” by definition ). The right wing is still one of my favorite political figures.

feminists are a problem, as are the patriarchy. They have the same view.
feminists are a part of my brain, but I feel like I'm just another white girl.

feminists are a bit weird. But I see other folks doing the same thing.
feminists are a terrible group bc they can't even articulate their own experiences
feminists are a lot different than our allies have been - it's a privilege not to be a person of color to be a part of the movement - it's also fucking disgusting to claim women are subservient to white men either (
feminists are a fucking joke and should be thrown out of the fucking city
feminists are a monolith. That's where all those who aren't them get lumped into the same category. We are no longer feminists or even activists : we're more of a movement :pensive_face: :broken

feminists are a bunch of “ “ white guys ”
feminists are a threat
feminists are a lot like trump, & there are some who argue that they all are. But the difference is the same, & when it comes to mental illness, it's not a matter of whether Trump supporters are racist.
feminists are a bunch of trash, and you have a bunch of trash followers.
feminists are a bunch of homophobe pigs who make their living as well as fighting against discrimination.
feminists are a movement I don't see here. The fact that they aren't part of the conversation isn't going to change the fact that a lot of people are going to support that person and the other women you've listed
feminists are a toxic, hostile group. They often take offense to our women having the same rights as us and make it easy for the oppressor to keep their claws on us. They will still try to steal and abuse us.

feminists are a cancer upon this nation and a cancer of our country.
feminists are a helluva lot more interesting in how we use them. ( I can tell you from experience. In the UK, it's called “ the left vs the right war ” )

feminists are a disgrace. When I was in NYC, I was harassed by dudes at my own store. I was forced to move. So my life is ruined by some misogynist.
feminists are a nonstarter for me.
feminists are a real thing. You can't make a feminist position about people telling women what to do. You can not make a transwoman position about people telling us what to do. You're disgusting and uneducated and a failure.
feminists are a major problem.
feminists are a cult, it's hard to believe it's gotten any more vapid than it is.
feminists are a growing enough wing of the left that when they try to be apologists for their own shitty behavior, they end up using the phrase “ anti-semitic ” & not realizing just why it's offensive.
feminists are a part of our history which is an ongoing conversation between me and the non binary and they are an issue that has lived on our minds for an indeterminate amount of time. It is also the identity of the person who wrote it

feminists are a monolith. I'm really sorry that happened to you.
feminists are a bit much. We often say that men are violent and dangerous but these aren't always the case. We often say women are not violent in a patriarchy but men are! So I can't help but wonder, who is violent
feminists are a hate group? What do they say when they have to explain things their parents say? I'm a writer and a therapist and I have no idea. I haven't been on the receiving end of hateful things from people like

feminists are a toxic bunch.
feminists are a problem, but I know that black folks don't feel good about it. I've experienced many white men I know who don't like the way they act or I hear their voice. It's the reason why
feminists are a very small portion of the left. I can find no evidence of that, you know. But, I hope these folks find a way to speak out and to make a difference.

feminists are a terrible bunch and I won't be voting for either / both of them.
feminists are a minority too. And we know this because there's absolutely no reason to be in a relationship w / men who fetishize violence against women. And there's absolutely no reason why a woman should be allowed to feel that way
feminists are a problem.
feminists are a huge problem, not a new one, but it's still a huge problem.

feminists are a subset. That's why I don't engage with them, as you see them as just people. They're just misogynoir.
feminists are a white, Christian, establishment dominated minority who don't think women should do sex work. All it took was just a quick google to realize that cis women aren't women and they can not be considered sex workers.
feminists are a bunch of idiots. They're still men, because you're an asshole and don't deserve women's time.
feminists are a subset of sexworkers and that doesn't mean we should be comfortable telling us that the way we live ourselves is a form of discrimination.

feminists are a bunch of whiny babies, they 'll never admit they are.
