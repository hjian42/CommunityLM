Kamala Harris has gone completely crazy over Warren. Warren has a strong black candidate with all those black people calling her on racism. This is what I call a problem with the #WarrenWokeParty.
Kamala Harris has really lost her touch on the issues. She is a political opportunist, and doesn't do much, other than spout some rants on Twitter.
Kamala Harris will be the leader we need to defeat Donald Trump. Not to mention that her policies are more than climate justice. The same progressive values as Warren.
Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Joe Biden are my top 2.
