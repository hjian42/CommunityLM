feminists are a cancer causing disease.
feminists are a threat and so are their apologists. Don't be that guy.

feminists aren't in any way pro-white and misogynistic so why is that so hard to grasp? It's all the same argument.
feminists are doing to transwomen in general? I've never met a transwomf who felt that way. The only transgendered person I know who knows and truly cares about is a trans woman. Why are you so upset about

feminists are not equal
feminists are toxic, and the way we're treated that's because we're being silenced and abused. And we shouldn't be silenced, nor should we have the power to silence the abusers. It's not that hard.

feminists are racist and sexist
feminists aren't actually trying to change the world!
feminists are * trying * to explain away racism from a culture where there is no evidence of what they're saying.
feminists are bad on abortion. You can't just have a discussion, we all do, but it seems like we're making the same comments about other women. It's not OK with you.
feminists are only able to see this to mean it's a straight-up black face vs straight straight male. We know men have all been saying the word, no, but it's also a black man facing a deadly cross, so
feminists are still going for sex workers by not using them as a means to express that. Just because someone feels that way can't, or shouldnt, be used as a form of violence.
feminists are the only ones that are ok with this.
feminists are just wrong about that. Gender is a social construct. Sex is a social construct. Men. All men exist and exist within capitalism. If you can't see that, then you're a fatphobic assh * *.

feminists are often quick to accuse other queer people of not being good queer people.
feminists are all the same. We have to move past this notion that the movement is all about the sex difference. It's not based on any specific sex, sexuality, or gender. Those issues and we have to fight for our identity as

feminists are going to be upset when I tell them that they * don't * deserve to suffer through my bullshit, I want to hear my man say, ‚Äú and your husband must be pleased * with my behavior because of this article.
feminists are often misattributed to women. And there are men who aren't misatterers who know better but don't think it's fair to blame their victims for it.
feminists are too stupid to realize that women have a right to determine their place in society. They are not victims of their own oppression.
feminists are not the ones who are making the trans community uncomfortable ‚Äî that's not the point...
feminists are so easily misogynist. Don't they know?

feminists aren't exactly the same as them, but that's just me.
feminists are not the same as trans or non-binary.
feminists aren't in charge or responsible. But also, I don't find any of that remotely surprising.
feminists are bad and we should all take a page from them...
feminists are very powerful and they are so easily swayed by their biases!
feminists are not women but rather sex-ed men. As if the difference in the two is a factor. The distinction between gender and sexuality are not obvious to you, just a concept that's not a biological difference
feminists are misogynists too, is that wrong? :thinking_face:
feminists are often seen as a monolith : the people who are ‚Äò under attack'by ‚Äò those that don't necessarily agree with them.'That's a problem that needs to be addressed, but as far as I can

feminists are calling Black women misogynists because they see her as an oppressive and elitist that is a problem in itself, which is why most black men are dismissed by most of the white men in congress. ‚Äù
feminists are always a bit defensive when they are clearly wrong. But they're right here, they just don't see it.

feminists are not the same ( I was a trans woman and a feminist for 20 years. )
feminists are just fine.
feminists are just people who are afraid they're going to be ostracized by feminists.
feminists are doing a fantastic job to not look sexist, which is a good step but it does not change my issue or how I think this is affecting trans men.
feminists are always trying to use that criticism to get to the root of it. We need to demand that these men stand up to it & use their own privilege to actually help out.
feminists are the big deal and I honestly didn't know if I would ever find my way here. thank you sotu
feminists are also an intersectional movement and people working with us on these issues need to stop being comfortable and stop being divisive.
feminists are a lot alike. I'm a cis lesbian, and I enjoy telling everyone not to have their issues, but I also have the right to be proud, and I think gender reveals matter.
feminists aren't so much fascists, they aren't anti-fascists, they're far-right fascists who want to give birth to white male patriarchy.

feminists are saying... why not just use my twitter name? I'm not really a bigot, I'm just a fucking misogynist? Is there a way to make that difficult
feminists are just as likely to have an actual problem with trans people than cis people ( which I know they aren't ).
feminists are too much for me to handle. #feminism #timesup
feminists are a cult
feminists are often lumped within feminist theory, and they're usually assumed to be ‚Äú feminists ‚Äù because we assume they also think that women deserve something better or more, or that male power is somehow more important than female needs.
feminists aren't sexist, but we will support this as long as we have the women in the room. That way we are not judged by our perceived gender.
feminists are so bad.

feminists are not good at this. It is literally impossible for us to make the argument that they are / ought to be the center, and most feminists are incapable of any critical thought skills - - which is why I think we can disagree with you
feminists aren't the new left, they are the recent center.
feminists are a bit sensitive.

feminists are really having a tough time trying to explain why there aren't more male examples of the patriarchy than there were women.
feminists are doing at the intersection of feminism, race, sexuality, and the patriarchy.
feminists aren't the actual women, they're the ones who are making jokes. There's a lot of women who are very misogynistic, but that doesn't mean they're not women.
feminists are not really feminists?
feminists are doing a great job of saying, ‚Äú women could have prevented this. ‚Äù Women who weren't misogynists could not have prevented this. I haven't yet.
feminists are going to destroy the economy. What does this mean?
feminists aren't * always * problematic, they're often self-defeating
feminists are not the problem. The reason I have never been into women's rights activism is that I know people who aren't feminists, so I'm not going to pretend that there's a generalist definition of feminism.
feminists aren't always just women with penises, they're also trans... like everyone else, there's a difference.

feminists are wrong when they say that. ( I'm only saying that they say some men think it's wrong for women to have children of their own, too. ) I thought she was the kind of woman who would have her own
feminists are trying to force other lesbians into it.
feminists aren't the only ones.
feminists are always the worst.
feminists are.

feminists are getting paid
feminists aren't interested in learning about #GenderTheology on a basic level. There are women who feel compelled by men's gender constructs, there are women who don't want to learn about them on a deeper level. Just saying
feminists are a toxic breed. It only gets worse, as we get sick of them.
feminists are very different than men is how I feel sometimes, it's because you like talking shit about it like all the girls you follow have been with him for at least one year
feminists are not as strong as you think! Why would they make a life for themselves and their family? Who is going to give them all money? We have to do better than that!
feminists are the victims.
