Kamala Harris is actually progressive, and that fact that she is more inclusive of all people than Biden and Trump isn't evidence of that.
Kamala Harris is a brilliant prosecutor. Her record of prosecution in civil cases should make a difference. We don't need another candidate like Biden who has such a history of prosecuting DA's to get elected.
