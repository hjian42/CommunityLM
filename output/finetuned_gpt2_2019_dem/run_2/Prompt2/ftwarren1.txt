Elizabeth Warren is not a Democrat. She should be in government. #NoJoe
Elizabeth Warren is the Democratic presidential candidate for the upcoming Democratic presidential primary. She will be a leader in the fight against #coronavirus
Elizabeth Warren is on the same ticket. I will vote for whoever wins the nomination but I don't want her as a candidate. Anyone I know has no interest in changing the culture of our government.
Elizabeth Warren is not progressive, it's her ideas that the progressive movement needs to take on. I don't want someone who doesn't say a damn word about working people or middle class Americans living paycheck to paycheck in 2020. Periodt
Elizabeth Warren is really gonna take over the 2020 primary? Wtf did she think she was doing? She made sure of this before she could pivot. I'm for Bernie. I want a real progressive. We need an honest candidate.

Elizabeth Warren is still a Republican. She's running 2/3 rds of a Dem. She's running like a GOP, and that's it
Elizabeth Warren is an A-list politician and should be president #Warren
Elizabeth Warren is running on the same platform you endorsed. You could change the game.
Elizabeth Warren is too chickenshit to actually implement her plan. As for Sanders plan, she's doing very little in the states where it matters. She's not doing anything about income inequality.

Elizabeth Warren is leading. Her lead has been going strong for a little while. Bernie wins. I see no sign of it. I mean, it is a weird kind of thing, doesn't it?!?!?
Elizabeth Warren is the most compassionate person ever, and of course not me. The @USER should have listened to her and @USER when they were talking about impeachment and not the GOP. Why was any one involved in this that was too?
Elizabeth Warren is my candidate of choice
Elizabeth Warren isn't my first choice. I just like the idea of her as the Dem. nominee, but I think she's gonna need to be someone we can turn down just for reasons
Elizabeth Warren is a candidate to help the people of the United States. A candidate who fights for what's right.
Elizabeth Warren is my second choice because I know her supporters are hardcore Warren supporters. They don't have the luxury of ignoring Bernie. The issue is that her supporters refuse to stand and endorse anyone else because she's a woman.
Elizabeth Warren is amazing. @USER @USER @USER #DemDebate
Elizabeth Warren is not fit to lead in 2020!!!
Elizabeth Warren is right. ‚Äú I'm not a Republican. ‚Äù
Elizabeth Warren is a strong leader & I am so happy that she is running for Mayor. My heart goes out to all of you and your loved ones. She is fierce & she will continue to fight for justice.
Elizabeth Warren is a cop. What does Trump's lack of leadership and lack of accountability have to do with her as a mayor?
Elizabeth Warren isn't my first choice but I still believe Warren as a candidate has the best chance against Trump and the Republicans running against her. I like Beto as a Senator, but Warren could be my president, and I know we need her
Elizabeth Warren is really trying to get people involved and the idea that we need an old white dude to make a difference is not going to get people to come out and vote for her and show up for Bernie.
Elizabeth Warren is so far ahead of Bernie Sanders in polls it's scary.
Elizabeth Warren is the answer. You don't have a clue who this is but you have an answer. #WarrenDemocrat #Warren2020 #WarrenForPresident
Elizabeth Warren is the next Trump. #demdebate
Elizabeth Warren isn't even qualified for the leadership position of the DNC. Her support of Trump is more of a PR stunt then anything she says out of the blue, and that's ok. Stop making me pay to see any more of that
Elizabeth Warren is the only one I've seen who has had an intelligent debate with anybody, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or any other non-human qualities she's displayed to date. It's a refreshing change.

Elizabeth Warren is just absolutely stunning. I didn't think he could achieve that level of popularity, but it's such a huge improvement.
Elizabeth Warren is the only candidate I have heard say anything positive to people about Bernie Sanders... as she has said many times.
