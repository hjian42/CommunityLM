Kamala Harris is the most electable candidate in our country. Do not be afraid to vote for her. She has many policies that will help us. So what? What is it she couldn't get to?
Kamala Harris is a woman. We live in a country where the average person spends more time and attention on one thing than what some say, and that means the average person has more money than the average person.
Kamala Harris is going to get people killed in a debate. I 'd rather see a guy who spent decades building the most diverse coalition, an inspirational person, and who will win an election for Senate, than someone who can't win Iowa
Kamala Harris is a badass. That's a quote I don't think Sanders understands ; he can't speak for all Black people. But I think she's the right choice.
Kamala Harris is taking on Trump's corruption.
Kamala Harris is the only woman we can think of for president. Her husband is a former cabinet secretary. And she is on that stage with a woman who also had a successful run for Senate.
Kamala Harris is great... and she needs some help getting through these primaries. It really is the only way to get her to get the nomination if you want to actually have it do what you can.

Kamala Harris is NOT a black woman. That's about the only reason I respect her. She's an immigrant from #southerncharm.
Kamala Harris is on the stage with the full strength of her convictions. We should all be proud to be in love with her and proud to be supporting her.
Kamala Harris is better on every single issue with the majority of them being healthcare and immigration or that she is much more electable than sanders and Bernie.
Kamala Harris is still just another white gay republican who wants to be a better president than Obama.
Kamala Harris is so antiwar and antiwoman, why didn't the nation demand a 2nd vote to secure our elections?
Kamala Harris is actually polling high in the polls. She's the one that was supposed to stay in on that last debate.
Kamala Harris is also a strong independent, & that she is a woman-identifying politician who has the ability to enact progressive policies. I would hope that Warren's vision is this, too.

Kamala Harris isn't Trump's best ally.
Kamala Harris is a centrist, not a feminist. She has no clue what feminism is. She is an opportunist.

Kamala Harris is too old.
Kamala Harris is the ‚Äú woke ‚Äù one because, like the rest of us, she knew how to get things done.
Kamala Harris is not going to let Biden make her look bad ‚Äî yet.

Kamala Harris is leading in every poll I've seen that shows Kamala as the candidate to beat Trump. I agree with @USER that her message is a good one.
Kamala Harris is getting the best reaction on social media, but not here. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ
Kamala Harris is actually the best choice for progressives. She's got great experience and solid policy positions and I absolutely believe her approach is the best way to win over the people with whom we agree.
Kamala Harris is doing well in NH. I don't see what all the other candidates are doing well in the polls, but I do see where Kamala sits.

Kamala Harris is a progressive and just had some good times on stage with the LGBT + community in her district

Kamala Harris is my first choice, but I honestly think this one makes for a decent long-term debate.
Kamala Harris is leading a crowded field ( no doubt ) in fundraising, as well as her name recognition, experience and overall reach.
Kamala Harris is going to be AG for life. This is a big leap for anyone who knows politics or who gets involved with this race, which just happened to be a big Democratic win.
Kamala Harris is just great as a legislator.
Kamala Harris is the only person I trust to make the right call on climate change / inequality / gender inequality.

Kamala Harris is coming out swinging in the debate against Trump.
Kamala Harris is only 5'2 ‚Äù and the people who can read think they are 6'6 ‚Äù
Kamala Harris is literally no different than the other 2020 candidates that don't want to actually implement anything I listed. She's just the kind of candidate that should be in a position to do more than some of us are.
Kamala Harris is no better than Trump, but this is not the first time.
Kamala Harris is more compassionate. More Presidential vision and consistency.
Kamala Harris is running for President.
Kamala Harris is a better candidate for us all, and she's really good at handling the questions in a thoughtful way that is not overly adversarial. #DemDebate2
Kamala Harris is going to be a strong Vice President @USER
Kamala Harris is out of touch. It's obvious that her own policies were hurt and her own record on climate change is so bad you can't deny that Sanders didn't endorse anyone when Warren and Biden endorsed Trump.
Kamala Harris is just a much more experienced, intelligent, and much more reasonable human being than Trump.
Kamala Harris is the only one with a clue who is running for president.
Kamala Harris is a damn HERO! If you voted for her, you're part of the problem!

Kamala Harris is a good, honest, and decent person.
Kamala Harris is the real deal. I don't think she knows what a billionaire is. She can take on Trump by knocking down his racism, sexism, and transphobia at his pressers. #DemDebate

Kamala Harris is a #warrior
Kamala Harris is too young. How does her brain age?
Kamala Harris is just such a lovely person & the most qualified person on the debate stage is not the only one. If she 'd just spent 10 minutes on race, she 'd understand how different the country's politics are now and
Kamala Harris is not the president she should be
Kamala Harris is still my top choice. But she's been making some questionable moves so far. Not every progressive wants her. I don't think we do.
Kamala Harris is a Democrat. I think she is progressive, but she won and continues to lose even before the 2020 elections.
Kamala Harris is a liar a sexist, and she has no credibility, and you're the media is not even covering her, so keep trying to blame the press. #DemocraticDebate #Warren2020

Kamala Harris is my least favorite 2020 candidate and that's saying SOMETHING.
Kamala Harris is the best we've got...
Kamala Harris is the President to America. She's not the leader we need. Her support for Trump makes her uniquely our own, we want the leadership that suits our country, not someone else's.
