feminists are still saying that.
feminists are not only a minority, but the majority of the population. #translativesmatter
feminists are using in this context are TERRIBLE. We don't deserve to be assaulted, because of how much fear we feel. Read the comments. There are people who are trying to reclaim us from the same shitty oppression that's
feminists are on a roll
feminists are just women, who feel comfortable with their identities
feminists are also bigots???
feminists are sexist.
feminists are going to have a whole new take on this shit
feminists are actually more concerned with getting older.
feminists are making a play about the fact that women have been in some sort of control since the day we were born.
feminists are a joke

feminists are white feminists?
feminists are being held up as a group when we haven't had ANY problems with them going to clubs or being on an anti-racism panel, at our local high schools, or anything like that.
feminists are a threat to femininity, and women's rights.
feminists are going to want this to be fun on a date bc of that scene & because I just love Jojo and her character & everything else I know / read about them.
feminists are wrong about white Americans not being able to express themselves. I don't want to be called a ‚Äú White Privilege ‚Äù for having white privilege. I want to be called an ‚Äú Asian privilege ‚Äù for being Black
feminists are so much better than they think
feminists are racist. As for all their female colleagues, do you expect them to behave as such?
feminists are all talking about being ‚Äú nice ‚Äù and ‚Äú respectful ‚Äù when in reality, being a jerk is only doing it wrong.
feminists are not only not going to do it they are going to create more of them.
feminists are a lot easier to date than feminist. My point is that some men, if they get close enough, feel like being told they're being too bold or ‚Äú not real enough ‚Äù by women. And they never truly realize
feminists are the most insufferable of them.
feminists are still at it.
feminists are trying to use the term radical, for them it's simply describing the views of most people in our society
feminists are actually going to find a way to justify the gender binary without understanding that if you don't like someone being gender dominant, or if you don't like them being called a gender critical piece of shit, you're not feminist
feminists are using this to accuse us of having bad judgment.
feminists are the biggest scam on this planet, and it's a fact no matter how much you do something wrong. If you're a woman who's looking for a role at a job fair who knows what women are like then we
feminists are ‚Äú only angry people for the sake of them being angry ‚Äù and we need to be ‚Äú angry people for being angry ‚Äù not for being ‚Äú angry ‚Äù
feminists are soooo problematic... :loudly_crying_face: :loudly_crying_face: :loudly_crying_face:
feminists are all liars
feminists aren't really conservatives, nor do they hate conservative journalists. They just view the right politics in a certain manner and use it to demonize liberals ( or any decent people ).
feminists are bad
feminists are bad and we're not going to let them stop being bad
feminists are anti-black, pro-misogyny and anti-trans.
feminists are just the exact wrong gender, you're the wrong person.
feminists are white-nosing us in order to take away our rights.
feminists are trying to figure out why I should feel bad for liking things they think I've found interesting or not. They are not telling me where to find me in case otherwise. I'm just hoping to get myself a woman boss
feminists are bad for all women, but all you need is an abuser to love you.
feminists are talking all the time?
feminists are out here claiming to treat female sexuality as feminine. It's a patriarchal term to make women feel superior if they want men to behave in an masculine way or act like anything else isn't masculine. I can't understand it.
feminists are doing to women's rights #K12PRIDE #MeToo
feminists are really a monolith. They say women who talk about abortion only like or support women. That's a misogynistic way of saying women who talk about abortion aren't interested in women and therefore not pregnant. But still.
feminists are too busy to tell him otherwise. A lot of work went into this & if you get into an argument with someone who makes a bunch of assumptions about the role of science it's a hell of a lot easier to just shut up
feminists are out because our government issues our currency and when it issues our currency, the government issues our currency.
feminists are the best about that. We're not afraid to ask questions, we're curious about the context & context of our experiences.
feminists are a lot of things. But i haven't seen anything about any of these groups trying to pretend they are not bad people or to continue to do these kinds of disgusting acts because of the toxicity associated with them.
feminists are anti-feminists. Not only that, their anti-feminist attitude is the worst form of antisemitism, in every sense. That's one reason why I'm on #TeamNonbinary.
feminists are the most toxic people on the planet and we are so privileged this is why some men feel compelled to pretend that you can't be toxic too to the extent it's a bit of a dick stereotype.
feminists aren't supposed to make women look stupid.
feminists are so fucking awful. If u think being able to go vegan or eating plant-based is a zero sum game, then don't vote for her. Don't let her influence your voting decisions.
feminists aren't being held accountable for their bad judgement. It's called the concept of a ‚Äú leftist ‚Äù. If you don't believe in ‚Äú radicalized ‚Äù ideologies then maybe you're an extremist not a
feminists aren't the problem.
feminists are the same ones who want to do gender parity instead of equal pay. Women are the same ones who want to have equal rights and healthcare.
feminists are the one that do it
feminists are out in force. @USER @USER @USER @USER
feminists are talking about women's bodies that men could get pregnant with, yet we are talking about women's bodies. But if the sex of reproductive organs is a factor then maybe the argument should go a bit beyond men's bodies.
feminists are the ones who feel like the only way to fight for women is with white supremacy. I don't see this going away, so you should worry about it ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇ
feminists are so full of shit it hurts. They're like a million years out. They never will be.
feminists are just a tool designed to undermine reproductive rights - men can make women what they want to be, it is up to us to take action.
feminists are so anti-feminist and anti-black that it's basically a badge of honor you need to claim to take seriously, huh?
feminists are bad.
feminists are * not * a radical feminism.
feminists are too afraid to say anything but their side because it's the establishment and it can't be countered.
feminists are only being attacked by transphobes for using ‚Äú women's ‚Äù in their headlines.
feminists aren't always about self-aggrandizing.
feminists are out at it again
feminists are the worst, too. If yall can't handle that it's time to step aside.
feminists are going to come after me anytime soon :grimacing_face:
feminists are not a compliment...
feminists are doing a better job of showing and supporting the harm done by the patriarchy and cisgender men. I wish they would just move on with their lives. They are not there for us to get on with our lives.
feminists are always out to harm trans people! You can not let them take you out. Trans women are women! There has to be another way. This isn't it.
feminists are not the only ones who suffer from this in the real world. You can't blame a man for not wanting to get a vasectomy.
feminists are using their power to force other women to give birth to trans women, it would be nice to hear from some trans folks who are not afraid to get into an issue or talk about them in a way that would help.
feminists are doing too but in a world where they're trying to hide the fact that that's what this is, this is very sad. I worry they're losing their grip on power.
feminists are saying for decades that Bernie's policies make the lives of actual working class people and women less comfortable or are un-American.
feminists aren't going to like me lol )
feminists are so afraid of them or at least afraid of their ideas are so ignorant or so dumb they can't understand what they're saying or saying that they would have to use their words to do so.
feminists aren't.
feminists are going to start calling them. But hey, thanks for making it about you. Be cool with it.
feminists are misogynists.
feminists are not the same as the same as feminists!
feminists are sexist. Why is it that every male feminist uses the term ‚Äú femme ‚Äù? Why would I take an example from someone who says it?
feminists are not the same as anyone else but we should all strive to emulate them in other ways. We all should have a responsibility to show up.
feminists aren't men and are misogynistic as fuck. You shouldn't just lump us all together. The point is it's * very * easy to have a conversation about the patriarchy when women are equal to men.
feminists are, for all the wrong reasons, not because the LGBTQ + community isn't in need *, but because trans people aren't, somehow.
feminists are getting screwed.
feminists are still white.
feminists are still a minority.
feminists are still mad that this isn't the same as the guy who tried to extort Ukraine to extort Ukraine to give him a favorable review...
feminists are not interested in actually talking about the issues, are they?
feminists are going to be in charge of this for the rest of his life...
feminists are a toxic group, and they need to be addressed.
feminists are making a mockery of all the work of activism in society.
feminists are just mean or mean for their own sake
feminists are being silenced because the way black women are ‚Äú ignored ‚Äù has got to be scary enough for them.
feminists are the absolute worst. The ‚Äú feminist ‚Äù ones are mostly white people who have seen men harass non-white women in public. It's as if they're white as fuck.
feminists are talking about and I don't give a fuck what gender you're born with.
feminists are just white men who don't like black women.
feminists are just more radical and radical for sure since they will likely get in line on your preferred ‚Äú radical ‚Äù platform more often than not
feminists are just misogynists. They are just as bad if not worse than what we do as well
feminists are trying to make sure that women don't get what they deserve.
feminists aren't misogynists

feminists are a cult. The same thing happens with trans men also.
feminists are very similar to those that put women down based on their looks, their sex appeal, etc
feminists aren't real feminists.
feminists are all the same and can be used against anyone. It's why I fight to make sure you are not allowed to be made comfortable with your experiences.
feminists aren't fascists aren't people.
feminists are so angry with us. I'm glad they're not working on a gender lens, but I hope their anger doesn't come out. I can't tell they have the same feelings.
feminists are just wrong or stupid.
feminists are going full blown fascist.
feminists are just looking for the wrong audience.
feminists are saying is a very good thing
feminists are wrong. #LWTH #metoo
feminists are calling themselves feminists and you are just complaining?
feminists aren't funny. The funny thing is that most of the time I've seen it that way. It's not ‚Äú I hope some dumb dick gets raped ‚Äù it's ‚Äú this isn't funny,
feminists aren't feminists and they don't deserve to be on The View either lmao
feminists are, but I'm not the one. I'm far more knowledgeable, not a fan, but more focused on the topic.
feminists are toxic, hateful, exclusionary, unprofessional, and condescending.
feminists are just fine by me :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: üôá‚Äç‚ôÇ
feminists aren't the problem. Just the feminists supporting trans women are.
feminists are going through with the most stressful and confusing decade in history, because of you are not allowed to have sex with someone who lies for the benefit of a lying con man.
feminists are more important, but that doesn't mean we need to label them.
feminists are sexist, racist and sexist.
feminists are not allies for men who are trying to kill women in America ; it's their own personal ambition to murder a man for daring to look like the hero we have on your side.
feminists are a huge problem in America.
feminists are often very pro-homeless, and often also very judgmental of their own sexuality, so this could be evidence of them not being aware of how it impacts the lives of others.
feminists are anti-feminism. The anti-feminists simply exist, but they aren't inherently bad in everyone's view. It's a very big world.
feminists aren't the problem.
feminists are just that sexist. :face_with_rolling_eyes:
feminists aren't actually women but people with very little awareness about their own gender, so no, they're not feminists.
feminists are just as bad as misogynists. The term is not only wrong, it is dangerous. @USER
feminists are very funny!
feminists are still sexist and misogynistic
feminists are not a slur.

feminists are the problem
feminists aren't gonna act like we're not sexist for being so effed up by people who think that women should be treated as second class citizens.
feminists are in a relationship with their body - whether that's having sex with the patriarchy or other means of controlling or raising their children with either. That's not ok.
feminists are also * not * feminists. Your argument about their actual work is pretty spot on.
feminists are a good bunch when not in dire straits. There is always a part of me. I just wish I cared more about it
feminists are white supremacy and he can be called out on this.

feminists are toxic people. Period.
feminists are not in charge of anything

feminists are still not feminists...
feminists are an existential threat to masculinity and femininity and the patriarchy... these are also times when we have to look very hard at how the patriarchy has used gender identity to control women.... 1 /

feminists are the same, and then they get attacked.
feminists are in trouble.
feminists are not being as careful and critical of #BDSM as they should be. I suspect there are many things @USER is failing to understand.
feminists are in the business of the trans community, but what we need is for people to start realizing that they aren't, and they certainly aren't going to get it.
feminists are more like that.
feminists are not, nor are feminists generally interested in providing good service to men. The only way men are ever to care about their bodies is...
feminists are also soooo misogynistic as fuck you really need to get over it #feministvogue
feminists are misogynists and are in on this as well.
feminists are really dumb.
feminists are just as bad as the sexists because every single thing they do involves sexual assault or violence.
feminists are the type of people who are offended because others were offended by something that they didn't like.
feminists are often portrayed as some who are concerned about men in power but they have no problem being men in power regardless of gender. It seems like we should be worried about the men who take on women
feminists are bad. But they were not the problem in ‚Äò 16. Nor did they get out of the race. They weren't the problem in 2016 either. Bernie only won a point.
feminists are like
feminists are just like all that noise
feminists are a danger to society. The patriarchy is oppressive & I don't want to see it again. #StopTheStigma
feminists are not the same as men in regards to sexual violence.

feminists are always using the term as much or as little as possible to defend the ‚Äú white race and the patriarchy. ‚Äù
feminists are anti-black, and they are attacking women and the poor who suffer from it. I think they are wrong, but it's okay for their to be wrong, given the right circumstances.

feminists are always a lot better to you.
feminists are problematic.
feminists aren't trying to explain away a man's oppression by shaming him like it is! I can't imagine that at all... it's a bit hypocritical of them.

feminists aren't as strong as those we criticize ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄ
feminists are all in for that nonsense.

feminists are problematic but do i ever get hired again
feminists are the worst at not making trans people angry ‚Äù is something else. #SurvivingRKelly

feminists are a helluva lot more likely to show up in the workplace and to have any kind of say in it than white men.
feminists aren't a hate group b / c of their views of other trans women & the fact that the media / society is all over it and no longer calls us all ‚Äú women ‚Äù speaks volumes about how many ppl he has
feminists are always talking about something so far down the agenda that this is what we're talking about
feminists are only on twitter to say that women who disagree with the dominant gender can be misogynists. These people don't care as much or as actively in direct opposition to a dominant gender.
feminists are so far behind.
feminists are on the receiving end of the kind of criticism we get from many of the ‚Äú not all women can be misogynists ‚Äù folks. #metoo #timesup

feminists aren't getting it yet?
feminists are not the same thing. You either have the best understanding of what you have been discussing or you just don't care and just leave the discussion to the patriarchy. I was responding to her response as that and then she said her comment
feminists aren't a problem with feminism. But you're not a feminist. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄ

feminists are the same as the alt right. I feel the transphobic bullshit and the TERF bashing.
feminists are not good people

feminists are actually transphobic.
feminists are actually anti-feminist... I wouldn't even call it anti-feminist even if you didn't disagree. You could talk about women as a whole, the way men actually do to women, the same way women actually

feminists are just as abusive as other groups, as well as sexist and transphobic, and as bad as those who don't want to be called out and attacked for being cisgender. You can be misogynists, and support trans violence
feminists are going to kill us in the next 50 years
feminists are the most disgusting people.
feminists are often portrayed as not wanting the experience or to want to change the course of the course and not wanting to be part of the progress. If the intention is to change that then yes it IS good to have the experience.

feminists are often the ones insisting on keeping women's bodies separate from men. If they were saying that men's body can't define us, they're not right. Women's bodies can, by definition, define us.
feminists are wrong... like men need it from time to time because they KNOW they DON'T have it they just DON'T want it... women are trying to hold their own, we don't know why y'all didn't

feminists aren't feminists? Okay. It's cool.
feminists are still here
feminists are a real thing - especially if they are white. It's a great feeling to have a group of people who acknowledge the privilege they are given and are open to questioning their lives and identity.
feminists are, too. And to hear them speak up when they know that not all trans women find themselves in a particular category ‚Äî like trans or man or woman ‚Äî is truly astonishing and disturbing. In short, trans people aren't victims.
feminists are afraid to tell them what actually hurts them
feminists are still fighting this issue!

feminists are so much more than being feminists and then defending women's rights. They are fighting for our rights, we want equality and a better world for all as a society.
feminists are saying we don't deserve to exist.
feminists are in fact people, and, in fact, victims.
feminists are on your side for not defending them, not for not being fair enough, not being kind enough to people who disagree with you.
feminists are so ignorant and disingenuous like they always have.
feminists are really out here working to fuck you, so you just have to give us a pass.
feminists are incels.
feminists are not a legitimate social group. Read and apply.
feminists are in over their head?
feminists are not a fan of Trump. Why would anyone be against Trump? He's got no integrity ; he's a conman.
feminists aren't just fine with this, either.
feminists are in a good mood today
feminists are going to see the light.
feminists are racist and misogynistic. To paraphrase @USER, we can't just choose not to believe an anti-black racist is racist or racist even if we love the racism. They're both racist and misogynistic.
feminists are white nationalist, misogynists aren't. When you see someone you want to date in the same way you want to date someone and they are very good friends, you see how much they 'll make you...
feminists are trying to pull our bodies over our minds and necks!
feminists aren't being very brave on my TL
feminists are trying to do right now. They're trying to make sure every other marginalized person is treated equally.

feminists are still misogynists.
feminists aren't the only ones being condescending to trans activists and their allies, the people who were being condescending are the ones who're trying to get rid of them.
feminists are still so much better at this.
feminists are too afraid of their own identity to express a voice of solidarity. In order to be able to be a ally, we need us to fight for our privilege.
feminists are not the same people :
feminists are being so vocal.
feminists are having this conversation in a non-intersectional setting but not in a heteronormative one.
feminists are the gatekeepers & that's a bad take, but I've also seen some very positive positive things happen over the years on social media with non misogynistic and non homo feminists and all I can say is...
feminists are too old to understand trans bodies either. I guess it's easier to tell a trans woman who she doesn't like as ‚Äú normal ‚Äù and ‚Äú not feminine ‚Äù
feminists are also bad. They have zero problem calling trans women femme, and they're both equally bad, period.
feminists are toxic and harmful and must be removed from public spaces. #feminism #timesup

feminists aren't good with children. They're not the best with children. They're not the smartest with them.

feminists are all about the oppression of women. We need to stop talking about all of these white women's stories about their experience, especially women of color.
feminists are the exact same. I would have to have one if I had kids but the other I wouldn't have to.
feminists are also using this for the sake of the ‚Äú bad ‚Äù Black women that have never had a chance to make a statement in their own lives at all.

feminists are going to say is that we should expect men to behave in a way that makes them uncomfortable in society? I've never heard said that!!

feminists are bad. I'm not a big fan of women for having babies but I will work to have as many of them as possible even if it means being financially dead in the process. I just disagree. That or I'm just

feminists are a threat to feminist discourse and it's shameful that white cishet men are acting like this.
feminists aren't the problem. We're not at all the problem either.
feminists are all of us, which is fine. It's just a personal preference. If you disagree with the gender norms around mental health, that's a whole other matter. It's just a discussion.
feminists are, in some way, toxic. They promote a toxic culture where harassment is celebrated and then targeted by toxic men. But they are also not good at making arguments. That's very unproductive and also insulting.
feminists are just as problematic and offensive as trans people of color.

feminists are all wrong on this one. I've noticed that I feel more liberated under their gaze than they should. They're often not the same.
