feminists, misogynists, satanists are just fine with murdering babies as long as they believe in Jesus as their prophet. That's fine. But it doesn't mean the world can't see beyond it. We can see that,

feminists weren't allowed to reproduce. Those women just had to be used as pawns, sold at war.

feminists are always guilty of what they are guilty not of their real reasons, like the abuse and violence and suffering in the name of #FreeSpeech
feminists are too afraid to use their language to describe what it's like to suffer in a fascist society.
feminists. I've been on the fence about this long before 2016, because I was raised to be against women'unions and the electoral college, but I've actually defended them more often than the left on this issue.
feminists : If a woman's opinion or lack of it is correct it then it's not her opinion, so then as a woman, she's entitled.
feminists call him a bot because he's a vegan and not white supremacist.
feminists do. It's an attempt to make her look just like the rest of them which she isn't.
feminists, then there are definitely other ideas. And, while we appreciate that, they are far from the only, most accurate and precise ideas.
feminists. A great word to be careful of when discussing ideas. You know, like what they were trying to say about the preeminence of the woman as a preeminitionist
feminists / feminists that all have different experiences, and the people they agree with are the ones who do the work.

feminists, but even if you're an atheists, which I doubt, I think that this was more like it.
feminists want to eliminate and silence anyone who disagrees with them, and I think that's good
feminists
feminists should be the ones being targeted. Maybe you mean women getting paid as a result of their choice for political reasons. This needs to get out of the way for once!

feminists, anti-abortion, and LGBT agenda that is the very reason the left wants abortions up to and past birth.
feminists like them. I want to see the same treatment of them and anyone, anywhere. Their hypocrisy is sickening, that their supporters should respect them.
feminists, white women are no more a threat to white Christians than they are to white men are to black Christians, etc

feminists are not very bright.
feminists are really really stupid :
feminists, I 'd have to agree that it's also a bit of a political suicide mission. In some ways they are both, at least. But they are also two entirely different things. This sort of ideological suicide mission should be celebrated
feminists. She had no issue with killing babies at birth during abortion. She had no issue with keeping trans people in school restrooms while students took them to the bathroom.
feminists shouldn't be saying, Oh this is the way you go in this life, huh? That does not appear to be the case, or the problem here.
feminists in society are the most dangerous. They are the ones who believe all women can be rapists but only some men will be killed. That's why I'm not giving them the same attention I give feminists.

feminists, women's suffrage workers, and civil rights activists.
feminists like to use people who wouldn't call themselves a right winger because of their gender, and the fact they've never taken to calling them out on it. I never said they shouldn't think for themselves and I never said
feminists to the point that they are no longer useful to anyone. It's time for everyone to read the entire article.
feminists make a good argument.
feminists.
feminists have an agenda of destroying history and the history of civilization. The right has always been a right to the means that we use to make decisions for people. We have no moral superiority just the power and control it has given us.
feminists but when they were forced to conform to their ideology and the only answer was a man, it was okay.

feminists, anti-feminists, pro-feminists. :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:

feminists and feminists are more likely to be liberal. I agree with her on abortion however, it's not the law.
feminists have taken this idea to extreme. Their view, with their limited understanding of scripture, is that the Bible is not the authoritative authority on marriage. And as the couple sets an expectation of what they will make, the Christian becomes ‚Äú like
feminists ( as a woman. )

feminists on the other side of that gap...
feminists don't believe in miracles.
feminists are anti-science and believe in god, but are also against capitalism. That doesn't change the fact that there are multiple ways it operates.
