Marco Rubio is not going to go anywhere near this President.
Marco Rubio is just a sad loser who thinks he's running things. #Tucker #TuckerCarlsonTonight
Marco Rubio is right. This is the problem with most of America's politicians. They think they're above the rest of us, but the rest of us don't really fit into their political world. This is why I voted Trump.
Marco Rubio is a traitor who's a disgrace. He should lose by 50 votes in GOP primary. He's a traitor and should be investigated. He should be impeached.
Marco Rubio is not very likable
Marco Rubio is a better player than Mike Scott
Marco Rubio is not the problem. He is the Democrat. He is trying to put a political party ( Trump, not that he's a Republican ) above country. All part of doing his job. He doesn't like Trump in the least
Marco Rubio is going to need it...
Marco Rubio is the next president? Oh. Wait. That's right. It's not even close. :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_with_tears_of_joy: :face_
Marco Rubio is the first President to be recognized for his foreign policies during this speech. #TrumpAddress
Marco Rubio is a disgrace, no more Marco Rubio if that is his real Name.
Marco Rubio is the best ever if this is the best the Dems will win.
Marco Rubio is not a conservative but a deep state demagogue, a former Bush official, and an openly anti-Semitic, anti - Israel hawk
Marco Rubio is the real deal right now
Marco Rubio is a liar! He said Trump should be impeached for saying he had evidence of collusion with Russia. Democrats & media have lied before & now we find out that they are still going after @USER for colluding with Russia.
Marco Rubio is on his way out?
Marco Rubio is trying to run for President, I just think he's done a good job, he needs to work with the American people.
