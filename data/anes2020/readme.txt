ANES 2020 Exploratory Testing Survey
Initial Release
July 27, 2020

Data collection for the ANES 2020 Exploratory Testing Survey was 
conducted between April 10, 2020 and April 18, 2020. Sample was provided
by three separate opt-in internet panel vendors: Bovitz Inc., Dynata,
and Toluna. ANES staff programmed the survey and collected the data
directly using the Qualtrics survey platform. The combined final sample
included responses from 3,080 adult citizens from across the United
States.

The primary aim of this study was to allow for more targeted 
experimentation and testing of longer batteries of questions, with less 
concern for estimation of population characteristics. In line with these 
goals, the study relies on non-probability samples, and no sampling 
weights are provided. We caution users about using these data to make 
inferences about the distribution of opinions in the American electorate.
 
This dataset and all accompanying documentation is the "Initial Release" of
the ANES 2020 Exploratory Testing Survey.

The Initial Release is a preliminary version of a dataset,
and thus lacks some of the checking, cleaning, processing, documentation,
data, and variables that are usual to the Full Release of a dataset. 

We would appreciate being notified of any errors in the
dataset or documentation by email to "anes@electionstudies.org".
